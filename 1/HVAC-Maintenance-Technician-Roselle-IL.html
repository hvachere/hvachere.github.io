<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the same period. Basically, SEER provides more information based on how the EER carries out in different temps. The greater the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
