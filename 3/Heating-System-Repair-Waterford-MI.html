<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your air conditioning system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely including refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. An experienced technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and effectiveness of your air conditioning unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
