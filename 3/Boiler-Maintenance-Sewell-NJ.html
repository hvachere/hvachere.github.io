<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has actually recognized structure products, furnishings, and mold as major concerns, but much of the danger also comes from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big issue in the developing world.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
