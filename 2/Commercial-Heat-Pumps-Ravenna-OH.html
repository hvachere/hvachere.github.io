<p>Examine these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to change the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor system if you do so. Nevertheless, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it may be wiser to replace the whole system.<p>
