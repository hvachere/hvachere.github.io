When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects.

<p>Oil heating systems are generally not really effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not accomplish a performance greater than 90%.

<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant might cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
