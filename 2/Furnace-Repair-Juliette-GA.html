<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
