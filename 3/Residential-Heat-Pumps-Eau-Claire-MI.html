<h3>Repair and Care for Eau Claire MI Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also needs to be in leading condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the house. The technician can examine the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or excessive dirt if the specific parts are in proper order. Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
