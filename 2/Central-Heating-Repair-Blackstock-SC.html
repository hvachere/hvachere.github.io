<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so.

<h3>HVAC Repair in Blackstock South Carolina</h3>
<p>Many house owners in Lancaster County are changing their home heating and Furnace systems from oil to natural gas, which usually reveals a significant cost savings.

<p>When installing radiant heat, you should provide serious idea to the kind of floor covering in the house. Because it performs and stores heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, however work reasonably well. Carpets will directly insulate the floor from the space, decreasing performance, so if you want to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, use a thin carpet with thick padding.<p>
<p>Because they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, below.<p>
