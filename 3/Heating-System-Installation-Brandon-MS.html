<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the home. Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air toxin might likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and infections, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
