<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
