<h3>Heating Service in Centreville VA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Though it might be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are many other contaminants that can not only unclean up the air, however result in other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products add to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (volatile organic substances) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
