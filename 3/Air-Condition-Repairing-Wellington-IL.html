<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Wellington IL</h3>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
