<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
