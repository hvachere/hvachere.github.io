<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold.

Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
