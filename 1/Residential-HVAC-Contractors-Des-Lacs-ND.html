<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
