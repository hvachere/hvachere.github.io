<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>

<h3>Picking the Right HVAC System For Your Project in Ponce De Leon MO</h3>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
