<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private spaces.

<p>The primary health effect connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
