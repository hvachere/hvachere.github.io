<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Beverly New Jersey</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
