Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for monetary flexibility.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
