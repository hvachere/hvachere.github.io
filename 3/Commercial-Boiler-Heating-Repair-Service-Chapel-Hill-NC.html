<h3>Advantages of Allergic Your Central Heating Boiler in Chapel Hill NC</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
