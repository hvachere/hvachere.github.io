<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
