<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
