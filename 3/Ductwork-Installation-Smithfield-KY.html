<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results via a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
