<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring removing and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at home over the weekend. Place control involves moving the contaminant source far from occupants and even relocating susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Just like most house enhancement jobs, the cost of a full central heating unit can vary widely based on the size of the house. Most heaters will last between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, property owners must think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the home. A little home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
