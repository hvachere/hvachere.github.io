<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the possible to adversely affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if essential, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs.
