<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
