<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Mount Vernon MO?</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home building is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in roofings, floors, and walls. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
