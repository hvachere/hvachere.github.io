<h3>HVAC Installation in Trenton IL</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Most well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water usually picks up lead inside the home from family plumbing that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested, the only way to know. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water evaluated. Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>

<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
