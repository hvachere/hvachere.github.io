<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Santiago MN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
