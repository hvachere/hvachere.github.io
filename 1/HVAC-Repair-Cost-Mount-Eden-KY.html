<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
