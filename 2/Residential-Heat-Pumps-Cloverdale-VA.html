<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Cloverdale VA</h3>
<p>Central air systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
