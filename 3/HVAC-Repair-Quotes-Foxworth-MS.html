<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
