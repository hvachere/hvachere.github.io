<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider possible effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's directions, specifically directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit effectively changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
