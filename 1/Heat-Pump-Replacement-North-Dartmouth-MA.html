<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the possible to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if required, update the structure envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more effective service to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>

<p>Old heaters often begin to make some unusual noises as they get toward completion of their life. Have you heard any banging, popping, rattling, or screeching noises coming from your furnace? Another sound is when you hear the furnace blower running excessively.

Does your blower turn on and off regularly or does it blow cold air sometimes? If so, this is a sign that your furnace may require to be changed.<p>
