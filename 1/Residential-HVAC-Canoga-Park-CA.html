<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We picked getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures.

He clearly and thoroughly described all issues and fixes in a way that made me positive in his ability to fix my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a required part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my better half and I would not have to withstand another night without heat, during one of the coldest winters in recent memory. He likewise responded to my call right away the next morning, and coached me through a momentary repair to a problem that could not be solved on the very first visit due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and ability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
