<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>Although installation is easy and does not need much time, trying this job is not a good concept. Unless you have training and knowledge of HVAC systems, handling the installation could trigger damage or installation mistakes that result in higher utility bills and bad system efficiency. Additionally, HVAC systems have warranties that require qualified specialists to carry out installation. You could void the guarantees by taking on that job.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it could flatter twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
