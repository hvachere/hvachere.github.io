<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>We included a brand-new 1500 sf office to conduct our workshops and needed some heating. After contacting Stability we were offered an excellent quote on a glowing floor system.
