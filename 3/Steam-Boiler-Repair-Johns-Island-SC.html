<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the right temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot. Only be concerned if your home is not heating up. However, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should call in a specialist to repair the unit and inspect.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family house installation business totally turn on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>There's a big distinction in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common type of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of homes in colder environments were heated up by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, floorings and ceilings heated. In turn, the objects in the room, like furnishings and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
