<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
