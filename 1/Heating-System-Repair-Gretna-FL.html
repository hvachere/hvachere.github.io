<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
