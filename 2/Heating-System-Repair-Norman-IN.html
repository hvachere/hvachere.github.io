<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was understood how hazardous lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the outcome of temperature extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow. Work environment temperature levels need to be kept between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air blood circulation must be avoided.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service strategy which usually consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
