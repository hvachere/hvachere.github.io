<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
