<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your ac system and heatpump should be free of all obstructions and debris. Obstructions can block the circulation of condensed water and trigger moisture build-up within the system. Excess wetness can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the residential or commercial property, uneven temperature level regulation, bacteria, and compromised air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to ensure all excess moisture flows away from the system.<p>
