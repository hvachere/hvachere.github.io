<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in roofings, walls, and floorings.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the home.<p>

In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it takes to substantially decrease direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs significantly. Consequently, the most efficient method to reduce direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate cigarette smoking there.<p>
