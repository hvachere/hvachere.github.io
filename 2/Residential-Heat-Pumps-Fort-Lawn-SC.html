<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
