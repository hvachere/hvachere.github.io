<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
