<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
