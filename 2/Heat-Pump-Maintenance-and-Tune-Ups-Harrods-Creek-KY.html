<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system.

When the air conditioning system works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>My oldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past.

The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
