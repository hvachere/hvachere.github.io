<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
