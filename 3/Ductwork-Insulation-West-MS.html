<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in West MS</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
