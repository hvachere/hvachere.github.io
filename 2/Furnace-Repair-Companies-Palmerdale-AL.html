<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
