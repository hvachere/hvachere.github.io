<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should evaluate and, if necessary, upgrade the structure envelope.
