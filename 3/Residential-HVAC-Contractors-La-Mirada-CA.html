<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.
