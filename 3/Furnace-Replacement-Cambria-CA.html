<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the tools or abilities necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician examine the system regularly.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
