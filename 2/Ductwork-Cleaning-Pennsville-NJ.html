<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.

Therefore, this might not be the best choice for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
