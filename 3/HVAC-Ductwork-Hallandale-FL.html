Initially, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
