<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
