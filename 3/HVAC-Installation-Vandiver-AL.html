<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send out the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it through software. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to analyze.<p>
