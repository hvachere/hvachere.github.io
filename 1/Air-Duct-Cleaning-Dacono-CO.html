<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
