<p>We take a look at hints before we offer recommendations to change instead of repair a heater. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>
