<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from products or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
