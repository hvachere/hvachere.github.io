<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years ago and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
