<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which in little quantities is not hazardous, however may become dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Bacteria or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread out throughout the whole office or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
