<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this.
