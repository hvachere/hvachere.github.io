<p>Though it might be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other pollutants that can not just filthy up the air, but cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products add to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some sort of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends on the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps typically need excavation to set up, which adds numerous thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
