<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>

<p>Examine these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On."
