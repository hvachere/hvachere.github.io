<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
