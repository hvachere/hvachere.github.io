<p>The heatpump acquired popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can draw out heat from numerous sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps move heat from outside the structure into the air inside. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only utilized in moderate climates, but with improvements in low temperature operation and decreased loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in popularity in cooler environments.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
