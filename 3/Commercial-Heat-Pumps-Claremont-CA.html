<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He assisted me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on price. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
