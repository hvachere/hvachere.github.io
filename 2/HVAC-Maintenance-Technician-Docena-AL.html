<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy. The old coolant will adversely impact the system's performance. To ensure the system is working effectively, think about having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your automobile's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service strategy which typically includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
