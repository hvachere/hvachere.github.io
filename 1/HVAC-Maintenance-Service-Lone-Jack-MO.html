Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be deadly). Symptoms of these illness do not show up until several years after exposure began. The majority of people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some industrialized disease from exposure to clothes and devices brought home from job websites.<p>
