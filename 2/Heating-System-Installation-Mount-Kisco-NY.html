<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with 2 local companies for quotes. While both were informative and valuable, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a better offer, for exceptional service. Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating unit and situated ways we might have more even heat.

Because of current warmer summers and for ecological reasons, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly.
