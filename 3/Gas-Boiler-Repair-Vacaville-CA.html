Pollutants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air toxin could likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care products. Germs and infections, animal dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
