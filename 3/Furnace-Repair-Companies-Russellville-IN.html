<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<h3>AC Unit Repair in Russellville IN</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
