<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Many common building materials utilized prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Usually, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Because the fibers can be spread out into the air during the elimination process, elimination of asbestos-containing materials is not constantly ideal. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often advised instead.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Great Product! Delivery was sort of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved issues. I would advise this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time.
