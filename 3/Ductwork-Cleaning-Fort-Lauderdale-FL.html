<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
