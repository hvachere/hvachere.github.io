<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Knightsen CA?</h3>
<p>Sean was really helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
