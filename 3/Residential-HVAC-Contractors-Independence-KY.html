<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of furnaces have multiple control panel. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t properly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
