Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
