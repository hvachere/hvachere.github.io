<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a different split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
