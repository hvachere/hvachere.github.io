They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
