<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the spaces. The majority of contemporary warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the circulation system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
