<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>Just a professional can accurately detect why your furnace isn't beginning. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems weird or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call an expert. Similarly, if the process doesn't work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you have to do it often, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
