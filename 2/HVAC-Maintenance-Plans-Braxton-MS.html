<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than models made 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years old or older.

<p>Since heating and cooling work may also require repairing or installing pipes to supply oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor might also be required to hold a separate plumber's license or have a licensed plumbing technician on call.

When getting a price quote, make sure to ask not only if a company is certified, but also what kind of license it holds.<p>
