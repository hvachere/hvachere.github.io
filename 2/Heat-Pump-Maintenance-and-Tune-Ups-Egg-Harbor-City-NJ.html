<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
