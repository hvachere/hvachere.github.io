<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
