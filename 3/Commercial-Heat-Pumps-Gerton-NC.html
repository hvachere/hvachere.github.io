Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
