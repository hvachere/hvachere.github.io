There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
