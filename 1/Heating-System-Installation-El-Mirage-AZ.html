In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in El Mirage AZ</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
