<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
