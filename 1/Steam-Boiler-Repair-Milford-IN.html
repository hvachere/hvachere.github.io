<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Milford IN</h3>
<p>A split cooling system might cost near to that of a traditional HVAC system but has shown to be an alternative cost efficient option to houses that do not have ductwork. Utilized together with other types of heating or cooling, such as portable or window air conditioning unit, area heating systems, or oil heaters, it can boost the convenience of your home while keeping your monthly energy expense affordable.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
