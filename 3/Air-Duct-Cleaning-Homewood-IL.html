<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
