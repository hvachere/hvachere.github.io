I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house.
