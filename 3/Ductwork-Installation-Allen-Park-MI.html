<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part.

<p>The company's head workplace is based in Cosmo City, Gauteng, and where they disperse their product in all areas in South Africa and neighboring countries, such as Mozambique, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. There are Jet-Air branches in the Western Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, Free State and North West, to supply much better consumer experiences and ease of access of the products in every area.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
