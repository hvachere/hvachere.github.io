<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable resource area recommends that "Air Filtering need to have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are utilized to decrease the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can work as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can decrease the effectiveness of the coils.<p>
<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint supplies, and car emissions in connected garages. Actions that will minimize benzene exposure consist of getting rid of smoking within the home, providing for optimum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint products and special fuels that will not be used instantly.<p>
<p>EPA's Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) studies discovered levels of about a dozen typical organic contaminants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside homes than outdoors, no matter whether the houses were located in rural or highly commercial areas. Additional GROUP research studies show that while individuals are using items containing natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high contaminant levels, and raised concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is finished.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
