<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While space cooling supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
