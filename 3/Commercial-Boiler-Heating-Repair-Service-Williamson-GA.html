<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Prior to installing any new heating or cooling system in a house, it is needed to re reduce the energy and examine load of the home. A more energy effective home will not only minimize the cost of a new system and energy bills, however it will significantly improve the comfort of your house. Before we design and set up any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Basic enhancements normally consist of adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can suggest a number of competent house Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>
