<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
