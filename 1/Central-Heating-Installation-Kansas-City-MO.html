Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can suggest significant savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, a professional service individual need to be required practically any maintenance besides regular cleaning. Central air conditioners need to be professionally examined and adjusted before the beginning of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this annual examination. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system operating at peak efficiency.<p>

<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Kansas City MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
