<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system.

When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
