<h3>Home AC Repair in Shafter California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
