If you deal with lead in your job or a hobby, alter your clothes before you go house and clean these clothing independently.

<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of weird being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
