<h3>Air Condition Repair in Lombard Illinois</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven.
