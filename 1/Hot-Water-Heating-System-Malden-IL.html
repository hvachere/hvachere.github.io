<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
