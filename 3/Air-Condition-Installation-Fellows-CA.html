<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, considering that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
