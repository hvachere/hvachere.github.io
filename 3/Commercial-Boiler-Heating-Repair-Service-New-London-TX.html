<p>Make sure there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else restricting the flow of air. Not only will obstructed vents and registers impact your convenience, they can also result in duct leakages due to extreme atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

<p>Many well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water generally gets lead inside the home from household plumbing that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated, the only way to know. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water checked. Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
