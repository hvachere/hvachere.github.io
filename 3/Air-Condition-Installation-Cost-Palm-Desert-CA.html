Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
