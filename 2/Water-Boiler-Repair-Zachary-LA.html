<p>In general, ductless AC systems are more environment-friendly and energy-efficient than conventional A/cs. This is since you can turn off specific spaces when you're not inhabiting them. On top of that, ductless A/cs can raise and reduce their temperature quickly, conserving you energy and money that routine HVAC compressors will waste by constantly starting up and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater.
