Unlike convection heating, convected heat systems have no ductwork and no air circulation. Glowing systems depend upon heat transfer by the infrared clinical concept utilized by the sun called view." These invisible electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a house, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones until a balance is achieved.<p>
