<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
