An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee.

<h3>Things to Search for When Hiring an Burke VA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
