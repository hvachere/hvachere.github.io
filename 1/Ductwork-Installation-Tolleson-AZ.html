<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and solidify-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>Safe private removed cable televisions to the flooring utilizing little blobs of hot-melt glue. Carefully cut and remove the orange mesh to free the cable. Do this to work around obstacles, areas and angles where full-width mats won't fit. Do not overlap the cable television. When the entire mat is fitted and installed, press it firmly into the tape and hot-melt glue any loose ends or bulges in the mat. Carry out a resistance test to look for damage.<p>
