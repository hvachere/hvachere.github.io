Depending upon the kind of unit installed, it can be loud and cause problems if you're extremely adverse dust. Furthermore, certain fuels and equipment may need special permits, and there is limited versatility in case of altered heating requirements. During usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the living space.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
