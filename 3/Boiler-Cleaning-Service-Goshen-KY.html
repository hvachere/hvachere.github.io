<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
