<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
