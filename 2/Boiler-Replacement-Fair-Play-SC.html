<h3>HVAC System in Fair Play South Carolina</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Turn off the power.

Then tug the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
