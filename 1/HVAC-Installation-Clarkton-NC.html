<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to start without the increase it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install evaluation results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>You're going to need to keep it in excellent condition once you have actually got the perfect furnace picked out and installed.
