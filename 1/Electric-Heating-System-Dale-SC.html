<h3>The Way to Maintain Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Dale SC</h3>
<p>All of us face a range of dangers to our health as we go about our day-to-day lives. Driving in vehicles, flying in planes, engaging in recreational activities, and being exposed to environmental pollutants all pose varying degrees of threat. Some threats are merely inevitable. Some we select to accept because to do otherwise would restrict our capability to lead our lives the way we desire. If we had the chance to make informed choices, and some are threats we might decide to prevent. Indoor air contamination is one risk that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
