Inappropriate modification, typically shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue.

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
