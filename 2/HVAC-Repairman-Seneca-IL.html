<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Seneca IL Home</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and trouble in breathing in some people exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might activate attacks in individuals with asthma. There is evidence that some people can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has actually also been revealed to cause cancer in animals and might cause cancer in humans.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
