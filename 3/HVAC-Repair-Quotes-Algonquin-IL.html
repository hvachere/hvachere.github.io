<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
