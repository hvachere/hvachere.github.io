<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
