There can be a serious threat from the cumulative effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to reduce the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from occurring.

<p>When setting up over concrete pieces, we recommend utilizing our insulation boards. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a really efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
