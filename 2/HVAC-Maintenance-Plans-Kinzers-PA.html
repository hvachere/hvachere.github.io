<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
