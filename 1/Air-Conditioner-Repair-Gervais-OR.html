<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is created for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of building materials, cigarette smoking, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in manufactured products. For instance, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as a part of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious.

Kids may have greater exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
