<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Donald OR</h3>
<p>Our team is led by the 2 Gamst siblings who both started dealing with air conditioning system with their father John Gamst after school and on weekends.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
