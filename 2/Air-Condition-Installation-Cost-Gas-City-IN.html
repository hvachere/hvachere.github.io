<p>Variable speed is the way to go if it's time to upgrade an aging AC. Already planning to replace an existing a/c? Presuming your budget accommodates a variable speed system, you must absolutely get one! You'll feel more comfy throughout the summer season, and your indoor air will be lot cleaner. At least, think about a 2 phase compressor for improved comfort and effectiveness.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air toxin arising from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off. Older homes might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are usually greater than in the rest of your home.<p>

Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
