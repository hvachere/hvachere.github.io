<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
