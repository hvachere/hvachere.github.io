This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
