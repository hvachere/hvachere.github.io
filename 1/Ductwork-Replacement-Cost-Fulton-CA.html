This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the tools or skills essential to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system regularly.<p>
