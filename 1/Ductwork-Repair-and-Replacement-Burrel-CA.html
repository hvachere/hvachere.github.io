<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at affordable energy costs. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J estimation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone. Similar to determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the proper size of unit for your home also depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

A split-system is the most affordable central air conditioner to install if your home currently has no air but a furnace conditioner.<p>
