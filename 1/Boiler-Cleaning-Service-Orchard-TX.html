If the one you're thinking about wants to determine the right unit for your home entirely on experience, move on to another contractor. Though highly influenced by where you live, a number of factors affect the size unit required, consisting of the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and placement of doors and windows; and the orientation of your home to the sun.
