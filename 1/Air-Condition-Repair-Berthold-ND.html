<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
