<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
