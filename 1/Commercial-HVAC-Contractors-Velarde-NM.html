Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install assessment results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
