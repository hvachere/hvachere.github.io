<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Location control includes moving the contaminant source far from residents and even transferring prone occupants.<p>
<p>Some health impacts might show up quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a pollutant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are typically short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just removing the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Not long after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma might appear, be aggravated or aggravated.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely specify the amount (and often quality) of outdoor air that must be continually supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be useful in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
