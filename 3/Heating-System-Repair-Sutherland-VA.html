<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them again.<p>

In this case, the control system is very critical to keeping an appropriate temperature level.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
