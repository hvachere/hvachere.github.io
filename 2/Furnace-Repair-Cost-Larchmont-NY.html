Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a harsh, cruel summer season.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
