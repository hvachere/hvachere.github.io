<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to offer thermal convenience inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture inside your home is connected with a higher occurrence of occupant breathing issues.<p>
