<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
