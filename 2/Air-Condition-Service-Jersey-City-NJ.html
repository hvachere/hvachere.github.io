<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may notice moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
