<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with your home. This company presented a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new home owner I have found out how to identify the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<h3>What You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Old Bridge NJ</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
