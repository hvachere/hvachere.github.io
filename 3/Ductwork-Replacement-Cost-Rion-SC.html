<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your air conditioning unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Just adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leaks.
