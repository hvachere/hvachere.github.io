<p>Great Product! Shipment was sort of strange being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we fixed issues. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
