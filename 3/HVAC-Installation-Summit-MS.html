<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Home Furnace in Summit Mississippi</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Once installed, underfloor heating needs essentially no maintenance and includes a 30 Year Assurance for overall peace of mind.

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
