<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
