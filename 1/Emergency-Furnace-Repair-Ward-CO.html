<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Ward CO</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
