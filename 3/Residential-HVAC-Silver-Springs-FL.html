<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
