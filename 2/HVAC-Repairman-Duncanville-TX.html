<p>Expert heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC experts advise following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
