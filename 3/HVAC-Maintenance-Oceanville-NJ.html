<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be taken to lessen contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens ought to look out to the development of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization procedures need to not be carried out until these problems have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>Intensifying the noted health signs may be job stress. In part, due to various aspects of office automation, the most demanding aspects of workplace work are increasing. Health symptoms related to task tension consist of mental and physical stress such as disappointment, stress and anxiety, irritability, anger, depression, stomach or gastro-intestinal disturbances, and muscle and psychological tension. These symptoms might be promoted by poor indoor quality.<p>
