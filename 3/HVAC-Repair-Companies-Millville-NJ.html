<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>

When they are dealt with in a method that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these products provide a threat only.

This can result in the potential for significant illness.<p>
