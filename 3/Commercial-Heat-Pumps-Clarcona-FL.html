<p>The function of a lot of building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and constructing security at affordable energy costs. Load computing is described as the Handbook J calculation and ought to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone. As with determining the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, figuring out the proper size of unit for your home also depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
