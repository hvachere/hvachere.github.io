Some sources, such as constructing products, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release toxins more or less continuously. Other sources, associated to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, remodeling or doing hobblies release pollutants periodically. Unvented or malfunctioning home appliances or poorly utilized items can release higher and in some cases dangerous levels of toxins inside your home.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
