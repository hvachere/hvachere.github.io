<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>For example, issues emerge when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in appropriate amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or positioned in such a method that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Poorly located outdoor air consumption vents can also generate air infected with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
