Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air contaminant might likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products. Viruses and bacteria, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
