<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Wood River NE</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I proceeded and purchased this Provider and I need to state it does the job rather well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool down your home which is among the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had previously. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
