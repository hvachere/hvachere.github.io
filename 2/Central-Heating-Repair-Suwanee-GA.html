Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your house, however there are numerous other contaminants that can not just filthy up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building products add to poor air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
