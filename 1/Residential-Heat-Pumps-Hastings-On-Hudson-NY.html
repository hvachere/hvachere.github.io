The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power ought to not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, given that the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level.
