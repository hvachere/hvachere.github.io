<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Rollinsville Colorado</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>People who are allergic to these contaminants should use allergen-proof mattress encasements, wash bed linen in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and avoid room home furnishings that build up dust, particularly if they can not be cleaned in hot water. Because vacuuming can actually increase air-borne levels of mite irritants and other biological pollutants, allergic individuals must also leave the home while it is being vacuumed. Using central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high efficiency filters may also be of help.<p>
