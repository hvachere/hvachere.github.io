<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.
