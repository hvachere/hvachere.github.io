<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
