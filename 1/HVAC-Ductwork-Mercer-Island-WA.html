<p>Information offered in this security guide is based on current clinical and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services should still be offered for your home's systems.
