<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment producer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in place. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often hard to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repetitive use of a part that is out of balance.
