<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair.
