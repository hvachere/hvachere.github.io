<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
