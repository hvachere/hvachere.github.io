Children, infants, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults given that lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more conscious the damaging effects of lead. Kids might have higher exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
