<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
