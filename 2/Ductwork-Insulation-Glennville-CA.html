<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time.

I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
