<p>We advise utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
