<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in concentrations and structures build up inside your home, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
