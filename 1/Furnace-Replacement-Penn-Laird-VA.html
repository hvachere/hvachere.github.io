<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Penn Laird VA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
