<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
