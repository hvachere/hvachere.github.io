<p>Lots of people underestimate the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is normally imagined as the black smoke discharged from factories. Little thought is given to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints used in the home.

<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
