<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and solidify-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
