<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may discover musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
