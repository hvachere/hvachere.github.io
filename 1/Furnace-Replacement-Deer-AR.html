<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
