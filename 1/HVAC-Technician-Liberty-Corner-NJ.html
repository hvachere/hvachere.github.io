<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because some of indoor units can be located far from the outside.
