<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Benefits Of Hiring AC Repair Services in Norristown PA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to check the ac system before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by numerous individuals.<p>
