<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
