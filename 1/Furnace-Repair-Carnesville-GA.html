Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor.

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter.
