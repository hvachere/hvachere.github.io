<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
