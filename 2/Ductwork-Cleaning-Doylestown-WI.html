<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
