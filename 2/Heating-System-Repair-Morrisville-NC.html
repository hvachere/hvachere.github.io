Even the best innovation ultimately becomes eclipsed by more recent, more efficient technology, which can result in a situation where it is more economical to install a brand-new heating system than to repair an existing one. This is specifically real of older systems that are not energy efficient. No one likes getting a whopper of an utility expense.
