<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Kamas UT</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
