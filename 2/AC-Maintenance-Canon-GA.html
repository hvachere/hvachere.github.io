<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Canon GA?</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the floor or right within the floor surface area itself.

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may see musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues.

But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
