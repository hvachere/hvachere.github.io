<p>Start by reading the installation handbook and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. A lot of systems include a kit that includes adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will ensure a safe and airtight  fit in the window opening. And for extra support, specifically for larger air conditioning system, consider buying a steel support bracket and mount it to the outside house wall, directly listed below the windowsill.<p>
