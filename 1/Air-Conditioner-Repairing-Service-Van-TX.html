<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
