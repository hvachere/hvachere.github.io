<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other kinds of heat pumps, have actually performances rated according to their coefficient of performance, or COP. It's a scientific method of figuring out just how much energy the system moves versus how much it utilizes. Most geothermal heat pump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for each unit of energy used to power the system, three to five units are provided as heat.<p>
