<h3>Home Air Conditioning Service in Richmond CA</h3>
<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to install, specifically in an older home. Depending on the type of system installed, it can be loud and trigger issues if you're highly adverse dust. Additionally, certain fuels and equipment may need unique licenses, and there is limited versatility in the event of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and fixed really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and performance if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
