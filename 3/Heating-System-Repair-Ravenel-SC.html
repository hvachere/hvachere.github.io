<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything needs to be replaced eventually. As devices ages, it ends up being less efficient. Central air systems and heat pumps normally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life expectancy, replacement might be the most economical service.<p>
