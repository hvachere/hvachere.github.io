<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one reaction stated the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided.

For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, causing cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
