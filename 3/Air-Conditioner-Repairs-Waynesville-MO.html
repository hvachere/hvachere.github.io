<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was really thorough and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out. Also Camryn supplied terrific customer support at the end of the appointment by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and performance if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one significant downside of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you whenever they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, although it was six months before the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
