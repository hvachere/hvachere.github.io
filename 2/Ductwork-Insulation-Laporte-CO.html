<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can suggest substantial savings in annual heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>

A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
