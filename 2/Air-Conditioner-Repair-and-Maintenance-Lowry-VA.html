If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the area, for instance, an effort ought to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects might be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air coming indoors or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions widespread inside.<p>
<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Improper adjustment, frequently suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue.

When the fireplace is in usage, always make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
