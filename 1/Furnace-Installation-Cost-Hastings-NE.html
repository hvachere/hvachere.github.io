Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation).

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
