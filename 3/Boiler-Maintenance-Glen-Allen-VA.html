<p>Air pollutants can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant arising from gas that gets away into your home without being burned off. Older homes might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are normally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
