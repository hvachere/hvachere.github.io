Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has seen the single-family house installation service completely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
