It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON.

You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
