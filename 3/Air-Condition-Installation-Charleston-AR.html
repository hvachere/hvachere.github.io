<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Charleston AR</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by just utilizing the services of a certified contractor or a licensed representative from a service or merchant to do the installation. If you choose to attempt to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed individual to do the work, in a lot of, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the a/c system. A voided warranty won't do you any good must the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the start and work with a licensed individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
