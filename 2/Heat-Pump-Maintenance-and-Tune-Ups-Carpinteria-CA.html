<h3>Residential HVAC in Carpinteria CA</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that the SEER rating is computed using the same set of temperatures across the board. The average summertime temperature to come to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to come to the right SEER score for your area, subtract 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score needs to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning systems manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
