<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
