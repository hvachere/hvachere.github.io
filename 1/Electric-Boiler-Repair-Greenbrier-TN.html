<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
