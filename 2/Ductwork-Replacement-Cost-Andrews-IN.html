The item was very lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit.

<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and repaired very rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
