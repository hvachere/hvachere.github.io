They're priced fairly, have actually managed the one repair I needed well, and are constantly on-time and expert. Have actually been through a couple of companies over the years and Wachoff's is absolutely the best I've had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been fantastic.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
