<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%.
