Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which might go into nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
