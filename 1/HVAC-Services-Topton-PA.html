The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Review of this data may identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of data may not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
