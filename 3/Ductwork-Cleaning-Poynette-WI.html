<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
