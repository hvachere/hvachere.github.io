<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

They utilize a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the space. The bigger the space, the more powerful the home heating system requires to be.
