<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you might have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare occasions.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
