If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make certain that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible.

Harmful exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly gotten rid of from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.
