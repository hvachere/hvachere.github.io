<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
