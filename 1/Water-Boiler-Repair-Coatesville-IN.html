<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable organic substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical substances. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., office equipment; floor, wall and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
