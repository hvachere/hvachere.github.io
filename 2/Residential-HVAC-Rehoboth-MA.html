<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
