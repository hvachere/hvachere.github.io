During use, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators.
