<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
