<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems.

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
