<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may select to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit.
