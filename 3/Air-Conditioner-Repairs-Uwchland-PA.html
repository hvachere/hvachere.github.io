The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the house.<p>

In either case, if you wish to keep your furnace heating for years to come, don't forget to keep it serviced and kept regularly.<p>
