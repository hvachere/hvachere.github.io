<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators.

Convected heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
