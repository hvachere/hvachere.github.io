<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions.
