<p>The primary factor homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services offered.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
