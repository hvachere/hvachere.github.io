This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While space cooling offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
