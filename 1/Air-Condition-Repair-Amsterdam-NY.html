<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years ago and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
