<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run since it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
