<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
