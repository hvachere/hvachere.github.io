<p>There are some ranges of mold that contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in many cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores. The main threat of mold development, as it relates to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than many allergenic properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a major breathing disease.<p>
<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint materials, and automobile emissions in connected garages. Actions that will decrease benzene exposure include eliminating smoking cigarettes within the home, providing for maximum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint products and unique fuels that will not be utilized immediately.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a cars and truck radiator or normal family a/c does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>

<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in San Bruno CA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home building is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, roofings, and floors. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater since the service technicians believed they just didn't seem right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
