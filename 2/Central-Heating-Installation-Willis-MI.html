<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The company's head office is based in Cosmo City, Gauteng, and where they disperse their item in all areas in South Africa and neighboring countries, such as Mozambique, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. There are Jet-Air branches in the Western Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, Free State and North West, to offer better client experiences and accessibility of the items in every area.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
