This is typically utilized in a third-floor or 2nd area and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
