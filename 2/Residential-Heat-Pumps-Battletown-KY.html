<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, professional and effectively done. The installers were respectful and understood precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and acknowledge quickly individuals who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are excellent and do not miss information that produces a job extremely well done. I very extremely suggest the two gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and appreciation for a task well done.<p>
