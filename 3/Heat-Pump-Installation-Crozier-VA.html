<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
