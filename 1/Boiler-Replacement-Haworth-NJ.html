<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs totally by providing an expert quote with choices, without pushing additional products. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the essential evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
