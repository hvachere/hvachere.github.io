<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in Houston MO</h3>

<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in Houston MO</h3>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
