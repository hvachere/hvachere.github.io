Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
