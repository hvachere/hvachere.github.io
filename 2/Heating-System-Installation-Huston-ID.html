<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator.

<p>Let's begin by outlining the preparation that needs to occur prior to you in fact purchase a furnace. Selecting a furnace for your house isn't as easy as picking one off a display room flooring. Not all heating systems are good for all houses, and there are a number of factors that definitely require to be thought about before selecting one. First, you'll need one that is properly sized for your house.

<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch.

The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan does not. Shut down the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan begins. , if it doesn't, you have actually offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
