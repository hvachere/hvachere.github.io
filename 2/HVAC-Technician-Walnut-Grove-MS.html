<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.
