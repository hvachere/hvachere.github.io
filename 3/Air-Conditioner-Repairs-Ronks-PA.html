<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
