<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
