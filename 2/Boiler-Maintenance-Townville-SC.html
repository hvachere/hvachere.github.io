<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
