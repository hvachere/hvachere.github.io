<p>Both should be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean up the condenser coil.

From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
