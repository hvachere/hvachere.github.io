<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
