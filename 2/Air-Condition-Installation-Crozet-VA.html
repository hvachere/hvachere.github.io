<p>The first air conditioning unit and fridges employed combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything.
