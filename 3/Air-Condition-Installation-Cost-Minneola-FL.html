<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, since the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not easy, because it considers not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

An efficient system indicates fewer repairs, so you won't have to be as thorough when it comes to looking for indications of difficulty and the month-to-month costs will be less.
