<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
