<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably simple to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants released by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors may trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
