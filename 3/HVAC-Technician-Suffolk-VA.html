<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Don't panic! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply might require 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat requires 24 volts of low voltage supplied by your transformer to keep the digital screen on. If 24 volts isn't gotten, you'll get a blank screen.

You should have the right amount of high voltage going to your furnace. Inspect if you have the appropriate 120 volts of power going to the furnace.
