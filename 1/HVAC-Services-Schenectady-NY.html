<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Schenectady NY</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
