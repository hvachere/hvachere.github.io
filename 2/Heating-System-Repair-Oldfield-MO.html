<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on preserving it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>
<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace.

If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>
