<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Saratoga Springs Utah</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
