<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
