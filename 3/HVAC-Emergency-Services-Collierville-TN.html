<p>Through normal usage and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system might become really filthy. These aspects of the equipment are important for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans all components, and checks connections to ensure they are protected. The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic elements are examineded for correct function and general condition.

<p>While contaminants commonly discovered in indoor air are accountable for many damaging effects, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of exposure are essential to produce particular illness.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
