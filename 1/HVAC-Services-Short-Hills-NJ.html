These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling effect.
