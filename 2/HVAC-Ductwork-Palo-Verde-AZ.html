(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys.
