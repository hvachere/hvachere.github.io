<p>Professional heating unit installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC experts advise following this standard guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
