<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Gramling SC?</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Gramling SC</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to evaluate circumstance & decided to choose them for the work. I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating system which was old.
