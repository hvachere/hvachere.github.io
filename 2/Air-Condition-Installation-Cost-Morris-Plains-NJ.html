<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

A good rule of thumb is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
