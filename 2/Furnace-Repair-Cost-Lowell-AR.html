<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, babies, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Children may have greater exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
