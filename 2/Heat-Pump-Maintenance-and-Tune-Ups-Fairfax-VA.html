<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Fairfax VA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in roofings, walls, and floors. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and assists tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by certified HVAC specialists. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements.
