<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>

<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
