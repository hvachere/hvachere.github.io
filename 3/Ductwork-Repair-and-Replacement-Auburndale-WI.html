<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
