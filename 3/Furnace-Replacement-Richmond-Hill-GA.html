<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the problem location in looking over the expense. He resolved the concern in one day, had changed the bill to what I thought about reasonable before he called back, knew what might have triggered the issue and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not take place again. I have actually considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They met my requirements entirely by offering an expert quote with choices, without pushing additional products. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also without delay followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
