<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
