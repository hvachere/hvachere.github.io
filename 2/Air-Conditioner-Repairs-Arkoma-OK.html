But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips.

<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider.
