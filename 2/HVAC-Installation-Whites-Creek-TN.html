<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
