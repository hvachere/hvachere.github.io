<p>The function of the majority of structure ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at reasonable energy costs.

As with measuring the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, determining the right size of unit for your home likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your house, providing a comfortable climate in every space.
