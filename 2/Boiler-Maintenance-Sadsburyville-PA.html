<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form.
