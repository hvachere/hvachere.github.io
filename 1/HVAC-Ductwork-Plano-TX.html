<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>A/c manufacturers usually make rugged, high quality products. Begin by checking any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
