<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
