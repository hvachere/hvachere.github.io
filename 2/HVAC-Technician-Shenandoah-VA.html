<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Shenandoah VA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the essential electrical enhancements to minimize cost.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested.
