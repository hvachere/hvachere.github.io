<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created.

Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home.
