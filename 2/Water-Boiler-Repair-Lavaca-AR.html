<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Particular kinds of HVAC units are a little bit more expensive than wall units, ceiling or cassette systems are neatly concealed inside the ceiling in the classroom and are for that reason more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to take a look at.
