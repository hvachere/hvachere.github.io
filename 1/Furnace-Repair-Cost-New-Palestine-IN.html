<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter once every 3 months. During high usage months, examine the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
