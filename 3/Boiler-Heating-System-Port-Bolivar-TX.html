<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
