While installing a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room.

PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room cooling provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
