<p>Air toxins can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air toxin resulting from gas that gets away into your home without being burned off.

In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
