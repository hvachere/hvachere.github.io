<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
