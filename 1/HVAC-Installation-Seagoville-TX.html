Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that an effective wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your car. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
