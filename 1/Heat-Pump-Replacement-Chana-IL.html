<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
