<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Sunol CA</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.  Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the unit has been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
