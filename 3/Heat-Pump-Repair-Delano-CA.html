Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Since a system is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
