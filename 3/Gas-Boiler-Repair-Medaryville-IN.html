<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales guy comes to your home he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the choices for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally higher than many heat pump alternatives, they can still be extremely effective, depending on the design you buy. One of the primary advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to greater temperature levels than other heating options. This means it can warm up your home to the desired temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
