<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
