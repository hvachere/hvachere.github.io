<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
