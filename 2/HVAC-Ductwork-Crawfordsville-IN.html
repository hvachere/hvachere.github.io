<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Finally, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can suggest your home may not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To identify smells in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
