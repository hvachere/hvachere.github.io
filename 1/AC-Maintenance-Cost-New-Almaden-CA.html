<p>The icing problem ends up being far more extreme with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater since the technicians believed they just didn't appear right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
