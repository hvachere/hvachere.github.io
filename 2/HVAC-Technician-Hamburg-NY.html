You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results via a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to analyze.<p>

<p>A health questionnaire ought to be developed and dispersed to all concerned employees. Such a tool should recognize the variety of people affected; specify ages and job descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they are located within the workplace; indicate when the symptoms occur (time of day, day of week, and time of year); provide a list of particular health symptoms or diseases; determine all devices run in the work environment; suggest the type of outside air pollution; and identify potential sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts might appear after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are treatable and normally short-term. Often the treatment is merely getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Signs of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also appear soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may see musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
