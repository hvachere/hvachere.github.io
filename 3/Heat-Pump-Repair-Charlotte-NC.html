<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions because they don't require any new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
