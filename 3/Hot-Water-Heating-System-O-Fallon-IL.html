<p>Initially, in regards to benefits, heating the entire home or structure from one system makes things much easier logistically, and the isolation of the heating unit from the living space is a perk for some house owners.

The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
