Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
