<p>If you're in the very first few years of service, you might decide to keep your product and services line simple in the meantime. But if you are an established service in the process of modifying your cooling and heating service strategy, consider whether you are prepared to add some complementary sales or services, such as pipes, insulation, duct sealing, indoor air quality evaluation or system efficiency reviews.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be improved much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by numerous thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is really vital to maintaining an appropriate temperature.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same way as an automobile radiator or common family air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Don't place the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will decrease the unit's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
