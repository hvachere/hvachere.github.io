<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Midway Georgia</h3>

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
