Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
