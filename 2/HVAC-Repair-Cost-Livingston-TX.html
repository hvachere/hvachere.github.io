<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year.

Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the roadway.

For that reason, this may not be the very best choice for homeowners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
