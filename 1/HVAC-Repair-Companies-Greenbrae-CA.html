<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
