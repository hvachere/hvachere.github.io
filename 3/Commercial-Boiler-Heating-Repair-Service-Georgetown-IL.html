On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having fixed the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part. He got along, uncomplicated and a thoroughly satisfying person to have around that entire time.

<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like a space heating unit) with the very same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
