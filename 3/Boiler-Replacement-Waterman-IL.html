<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
