<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
