<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants flowing through your system.

When it does require to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install.
