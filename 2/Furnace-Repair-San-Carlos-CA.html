<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require relatively little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is essential to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leaks, the system must be flushed regularly to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in tough water areas).

The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
