<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, much of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building."

If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
