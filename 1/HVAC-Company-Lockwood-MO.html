<p>We take a look at clues before we provide advice to change instead of repair a heater. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older system.<p>

<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is dirty, and filters are plugged, and perhaps refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimal effectiveness and could get too hot.

It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not huge enough for your house. If the system is too small, it will need to work more difficult and might get too hot. Generally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
