<p>A matched system is the combination of products that make up your HVAC system.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
