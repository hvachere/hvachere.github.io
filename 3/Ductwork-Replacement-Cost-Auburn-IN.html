<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
