<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers in New Milford NJ</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
