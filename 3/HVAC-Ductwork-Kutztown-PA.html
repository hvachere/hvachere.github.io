<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
