<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, talk with your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>

Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
