If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences.
