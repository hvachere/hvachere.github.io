<p>Using air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable Energy area suggests that "Air Filtering should have a Minimum Performance Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are utilized to reduce the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can work as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can lower the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>Some health results may appear soon after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are normally short-term and treatable.
