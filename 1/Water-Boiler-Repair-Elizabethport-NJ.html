<p>Not all sensors work the same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>
