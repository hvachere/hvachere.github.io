<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Pewee Valley KY</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to find an honest AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
