<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in location. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one response specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided.
