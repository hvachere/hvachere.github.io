<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
