<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

The circuit boards collaborate the operation and manage of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the brand-new control panel should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
