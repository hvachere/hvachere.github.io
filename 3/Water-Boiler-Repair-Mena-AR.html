<p>Measurement procedures are being established and shown to examine structure ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These procedures vary from advanced tracer gas methods used mainly in building research study efforts to less involved treatments that can be employed by building operators. NIST scientists are continuously establishing new test procedures, and then demonstrating them in the field to examine their expediency and dependability. The efforts in which these procedures are shown in the field has actually resulted in the development of a crucial database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>
<p>Equipment expenses are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your home heating unit. Low-efficiency models will cost less, but lead to higher energy costs. High-efficiency designs cost more, however save more over the long run. Costs for gas heaters range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs up to $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric heaters begin at $395 and vary up to $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions.
