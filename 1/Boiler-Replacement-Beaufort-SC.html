<p>My eldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before.

The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC use the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for generating power in the form of electrical power. The two operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
