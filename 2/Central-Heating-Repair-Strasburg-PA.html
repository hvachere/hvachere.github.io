<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
