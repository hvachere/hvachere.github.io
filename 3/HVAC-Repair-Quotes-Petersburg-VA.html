<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power needs to not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, considering that it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
