<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are easily breathed in.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
