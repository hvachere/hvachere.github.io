<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They include delays in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Children may have higher exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
