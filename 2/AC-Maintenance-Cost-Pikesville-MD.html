<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
