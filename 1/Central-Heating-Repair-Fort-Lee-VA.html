<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Picture 6).<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Fort Lee VA</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as different as the various houses they serve (single family homes, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condos, row real estate, etc.). No matter what the kind of home HVAC system, adequate air flow (ventilation), proper filtration, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is operating safely and not adding to or triggering an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>I have ended up being fairly proficient at researching products on line prior to buying them. However I don't find that there is a central place for browsing info about the "true" worth of home HVAC systems or perhaps I must state a sincere assessment of these items.
