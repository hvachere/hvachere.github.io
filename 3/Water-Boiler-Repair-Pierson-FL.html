<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Pierson FL</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
