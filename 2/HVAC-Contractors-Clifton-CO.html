<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
