<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
