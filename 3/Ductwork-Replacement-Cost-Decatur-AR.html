<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Decatur AR</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
