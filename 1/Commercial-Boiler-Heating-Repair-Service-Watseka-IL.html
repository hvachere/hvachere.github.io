<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
