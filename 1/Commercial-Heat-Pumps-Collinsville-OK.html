The EPA study recommended and controlled techniques used on a smaller number of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both studies have flaws, no other research has challenged the findings.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up.

Hope this assists.<p>
