<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract tries to upsell you each time they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was 6 months prior to the present one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
