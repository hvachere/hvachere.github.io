<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
