<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
