<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
