<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in Rhome TX</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
