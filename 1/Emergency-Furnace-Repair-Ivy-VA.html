<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power ought to not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, given that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level.

Newer gas boilers need to accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
