<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outdoors air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
