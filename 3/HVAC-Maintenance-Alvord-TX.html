<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
