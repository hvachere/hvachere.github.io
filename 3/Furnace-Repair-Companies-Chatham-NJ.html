<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gas, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not normally consist of lead. Water generally gets lead inside the home from household plumbing that is made with lead materials. The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to discover how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
