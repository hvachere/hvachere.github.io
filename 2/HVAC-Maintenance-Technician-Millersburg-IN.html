<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are prone to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>

<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's directions, specifically directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is typically an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating system is in use, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
