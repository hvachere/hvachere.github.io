<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limitations use dose-response data which reveal the health effects of repeated direct exposure to one particular chemical. Similar data is not available for long-lasting, low-level exposures to a mix of pollutants as is the case for IAQ issues. Currently, there is not enough details available to forecast the effects of direct exposure to numerous potentially harmful agents at the exact same time.<p>
