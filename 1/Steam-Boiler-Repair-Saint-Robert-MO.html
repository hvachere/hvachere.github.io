<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems at Saint Robert MO</h3>
<p>In the last numerous years, a growing body of clinical evidence has shown that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously contaminated than the outside air in even the largest and most industrialized cities.

When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
