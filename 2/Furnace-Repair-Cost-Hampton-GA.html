I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
