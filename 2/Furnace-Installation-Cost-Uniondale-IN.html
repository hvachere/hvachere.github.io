<p>In general, ductless AC units are more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient than traditional Heating and coolings. This is since you can shut off private rooms when you're not inhabiting them. On top of that, ductless Air conditionings can raise and decrease their temperature quickly, saving you energy and money that regular HVAC compressors will lose by constantly launching and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heater appears less like a high-end item and more like a requirement.
