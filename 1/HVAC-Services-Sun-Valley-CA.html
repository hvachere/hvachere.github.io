<h3>HVAC repair services in Sun Valley CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions.

The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
