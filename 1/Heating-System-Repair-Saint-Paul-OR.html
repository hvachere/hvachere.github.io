<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
