<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>There are a couple of main things that property owners will want to consider when deciding which of the very best AC systems they must install in their homes. It really depends upon what you value the most in a top brand name central air conditioning conditioner. The major elements for a lot of homeowners will be the total cost to install the best air conditioning unit brand names, life expectancy of the AC system, service warranties offered, energy performance (SEER scores), and size of the system you need for your house's square video footage (LOTS) to efficiently cool your home.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
