<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floors, floor drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and structures build up inside your home, direct exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
