<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
