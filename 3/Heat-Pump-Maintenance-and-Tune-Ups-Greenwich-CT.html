<h3>The Way to Select An Expert HVAC Technician in Greenwich CT</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Central air systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
