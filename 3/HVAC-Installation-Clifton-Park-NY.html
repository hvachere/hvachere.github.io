<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and cooling system.

<p>Not all sensors work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
