Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in a lot of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>

<p>Do you need to replace or repair part of your house's HVAC system?

Whether you're in need of an inspection, repair, installation or maintenance for your HVAC system, you can depend on the specialists at AAA Heating & Cooling to get the job done right.<p>
<p>When you invest in a new heating and cooling system, you're purchasing your home, your household, and your service.

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Damp and damp conditions breed mold and mildew that can trigger respiratory concerns like allergies and asthma. Depending upon your place, the hot summer months can cause particularly humid conditions. Lower the amount of wetness in the air and curb the development of irritating molds with a few well-placed dehumidifiers. There are a variety of humidifier options that will help maintain consistent humidity levels and develop comfortable living conditions in your house.<p>
