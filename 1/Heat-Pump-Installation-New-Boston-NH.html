<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
