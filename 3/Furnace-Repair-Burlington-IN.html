<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
