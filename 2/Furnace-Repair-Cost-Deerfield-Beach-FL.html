<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
