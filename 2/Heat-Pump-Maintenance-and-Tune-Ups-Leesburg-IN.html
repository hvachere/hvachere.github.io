The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>Both need to be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean the condenser coil.

When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
