<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
