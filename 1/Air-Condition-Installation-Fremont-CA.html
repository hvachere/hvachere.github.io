<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time.
