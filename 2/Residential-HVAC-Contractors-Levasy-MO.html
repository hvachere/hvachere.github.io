<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to develop a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-134a and r-404a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>If no pollutant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air might also be an issue when ventilation is not sufficient to represent an increase in the variety of employees in the location.<p>
<p>For toxins besides radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health signs or signs of poor ventilation and particular sources or pollutants have been identified as possible causes of indoor air quality issues.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a car radiator or typical family a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
