<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
