<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
