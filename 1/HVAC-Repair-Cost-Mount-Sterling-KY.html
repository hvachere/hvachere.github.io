<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years ago and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and maybe refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimal efficiency and might get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also cause your energy costs to increase. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not big enough for your home. It will have to work more difficult and may get too hot if the system is too small. Generally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
