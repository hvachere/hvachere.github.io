Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up.

Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
