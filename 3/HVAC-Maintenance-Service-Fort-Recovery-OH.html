<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
