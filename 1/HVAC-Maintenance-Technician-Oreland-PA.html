<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
