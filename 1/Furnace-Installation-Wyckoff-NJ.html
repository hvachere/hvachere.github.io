<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain poisonous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible most of the times, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The main danger of mold growth, as it associates with indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than the majority of allergenic properties is the ability of mold to set off episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a serious respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
