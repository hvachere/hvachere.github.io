<p>Immediate impacts may show up after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are typically short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is simply getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the United States your home lies, the local area's climate can alter significantly. A house situated in the South would require an AC unit with a size efficient in cooling your house due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the United States would need a much bigger heating capability also which will impact costs.
