<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Spanaway WA</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it significantly difficult for your lungs to work effectively, and can have unfavorable health affects.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
