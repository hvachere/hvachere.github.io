<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage.

Furnaces that kick on frequently might be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
