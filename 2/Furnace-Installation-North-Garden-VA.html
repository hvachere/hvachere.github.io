<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
