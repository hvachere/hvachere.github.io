<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
