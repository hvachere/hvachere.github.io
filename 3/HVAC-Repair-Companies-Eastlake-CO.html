<p>Customer products which contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to cause cancer in animals.

<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>

Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
