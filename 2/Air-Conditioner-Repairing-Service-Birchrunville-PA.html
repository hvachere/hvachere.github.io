<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites need to find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a vicious, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system cooling", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioner to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
