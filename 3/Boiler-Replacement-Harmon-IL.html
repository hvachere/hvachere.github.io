<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow constraint will decrease the system's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>

<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.
