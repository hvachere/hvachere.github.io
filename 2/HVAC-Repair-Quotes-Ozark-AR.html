<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

<h3>Facts All Ozark AR Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to purchase it. My better half said that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have actually met in a long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real individuals who are there for us. Please do.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
