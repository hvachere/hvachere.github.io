<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
