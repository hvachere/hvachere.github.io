<h3>Air Condition Repairing in Zebulon Georgia</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace should also be examined regularly. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire threat.
