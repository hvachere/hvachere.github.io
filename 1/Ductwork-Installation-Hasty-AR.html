While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, because some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
