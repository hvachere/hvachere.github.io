<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and cure-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
