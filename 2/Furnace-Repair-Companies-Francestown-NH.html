<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
