<p>Measurement procedures are being developed and shown to evaluate structure ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These treatments vary from sophisticated tracer gas approaches used mainly in constructing research study efforts to less involved procedures that can be employed by developing operators.

The efforts in which these treatments are demonstrated in the field has resulted in the development of an essential database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the skills or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still required to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>

However, pick your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
