<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, infants, and kids are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead.
