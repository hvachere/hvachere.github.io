<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
