<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
