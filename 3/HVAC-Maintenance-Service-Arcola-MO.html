<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate substantial cost savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The EPA advises that you have your air ducts examined by a professional heating and cooling contractor. If your technician discovers that your air ducts have significant mold, dust, dirt, and other pollutants or a musty smell, they might suggest duct cleaning This is specifically important if someone in your household has asthma, allergies, or other signs that may be related to indoor air pollution.<p>

<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and hence needs conditions suitable for both organisms. The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial structures vary, but typically include really warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and sometimes flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive procedures include changing typical hot water levels to enable 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, examining facility design layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and periodic screening in suspect locations.<p>
