<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Brookhaven MS</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
