<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working, integrity Energy was quick to react. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new heaters can heat the house. Honestly, our house heater is made complex, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
