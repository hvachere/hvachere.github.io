<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices maker's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to measure, as one response mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated usage of a part that is out of balance.
