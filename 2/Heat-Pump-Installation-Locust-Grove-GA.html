<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
