<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
