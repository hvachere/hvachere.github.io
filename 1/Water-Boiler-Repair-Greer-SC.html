<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Companies in Greer</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Professional heating unit setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period. Basically, SEER offers more data based on how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
