<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
