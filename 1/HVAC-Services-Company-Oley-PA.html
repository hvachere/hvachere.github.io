Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
