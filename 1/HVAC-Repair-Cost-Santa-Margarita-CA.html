<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Service in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient.

Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, a professional service person must be called for almost any maintenance aside from regular cleaning.
