<p>Lots of people undervalue the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is usually envisioned as the black smoke emitted from factories.

<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably reduces direct exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Improper modification, typically shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a new gas stove or range. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your home. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
