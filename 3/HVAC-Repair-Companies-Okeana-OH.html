<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
