<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other contaminants that can not only dirty up the air, however cause other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure materials contribute to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic substances) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
