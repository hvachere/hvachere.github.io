<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized.

<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Porter TX?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
