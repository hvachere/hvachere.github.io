<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater airflow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and new air purification technologies are becoming more common as readily available options in commercial and residential HVAC item packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been extensive, as clients stay mainly unconcerned to the effects of air quality on health and performance.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
