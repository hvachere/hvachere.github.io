<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>If you operate in building and construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you may unknowingly bring lead into your house on your clothes or hands. You might also be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil very near homes might be infected from lead paint on the exterior of the structure. Soil by highways and roadways may be infected from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet prior to getting in the house. Alter your clothes prior to you go house and clean these clothing separately if you work with lead in your task or a hobby. Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy locations rather of dirt which stays with fingers and toys. Try to keep your children from consuming dirt, and make sure they wash their hands when they come within.<p>
