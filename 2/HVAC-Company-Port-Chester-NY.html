<p>Current Review: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They met my requirements completely by providing an expert quote with choices, without pressing extra items. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also immediately followed up with the essential evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract tries to upsell you each time they pertain to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't need a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
