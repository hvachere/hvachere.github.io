<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year.

It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the start of chest discomfort.
