<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
