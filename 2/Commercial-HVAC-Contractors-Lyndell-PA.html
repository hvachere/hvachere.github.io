<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
