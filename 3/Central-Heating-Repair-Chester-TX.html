<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
