<p>A specific air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioner in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the very same air path. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, given that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is actually warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>

Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability.
