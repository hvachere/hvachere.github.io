<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems in homes. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults given that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Kids may have higher exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
