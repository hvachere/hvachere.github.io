<p>My oldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time repairing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
