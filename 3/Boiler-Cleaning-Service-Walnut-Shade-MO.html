What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
