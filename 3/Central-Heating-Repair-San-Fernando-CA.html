<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in San Fernando CA</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
