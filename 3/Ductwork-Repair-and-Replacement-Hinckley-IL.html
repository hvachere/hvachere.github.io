Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
