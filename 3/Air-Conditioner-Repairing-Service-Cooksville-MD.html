<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy.
