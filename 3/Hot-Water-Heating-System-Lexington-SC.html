<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
