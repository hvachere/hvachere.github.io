The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same.

If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
