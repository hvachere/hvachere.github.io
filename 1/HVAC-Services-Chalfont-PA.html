<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is typically used in a third-floor or 2nd area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
