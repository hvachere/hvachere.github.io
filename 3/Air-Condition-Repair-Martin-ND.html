<p>Ruud ac system are an inexpensive HVAC system that offers a complete lineup of heating & cooling items. The Ruud Achiever RA16 which has a 16 SEER energy effectiveness would cost anywhere in between $3,500 to $3,695 to install. There's lots of testing and consumer evaluates that credit Ruud AC units as being long-lasting. They also have available parts throughout the U.S. so their warranties & replacements are really time efficient.

<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough task that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps guys working. When a sales guy comes to your house he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>
