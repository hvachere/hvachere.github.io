<p>It might just need to be cleaned up if your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running. Whether or not this is the cause of the issue, it's a good early treatment to try.

Dust can work as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can minimize the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up just a couple of years back.<p>
