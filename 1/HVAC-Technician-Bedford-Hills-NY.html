<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces at Bedford Hills NY</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater.
