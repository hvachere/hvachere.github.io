<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
