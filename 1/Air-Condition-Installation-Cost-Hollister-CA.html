<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Plan on spending numerous thousand dollars for the complete system if you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your home.
