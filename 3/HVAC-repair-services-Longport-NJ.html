An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.
