<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can suggest significant savings in yearly heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>

Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
