<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
