<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
