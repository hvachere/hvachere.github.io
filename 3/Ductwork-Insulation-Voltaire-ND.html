The job of an HVAC technician is fairly complex and can vary significantly from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance task may need totally various steps and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being examined. Setups can also differ substantially, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. Sometimes, completely brand-new ductwork might need to be installed in a structure that had none prior to.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
