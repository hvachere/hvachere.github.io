<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He assisted me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very handy in collecting information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
