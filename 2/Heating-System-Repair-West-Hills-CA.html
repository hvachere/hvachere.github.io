<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of allowing heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
