Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
