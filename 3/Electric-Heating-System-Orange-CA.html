Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

<h3>Ductwork Insulation in Orange CA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
