Breathing air toxins can result in allergic and asthmatic reactions, infections and other illness that include the lungs, nose and throat.

<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
