<p>UW visitors, staff members and students must have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and carry out numerous activities. If the air quality is bad it can affect a person's productivity, comfort, and health.  The purpose of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to offer and preserve healthy and comfy environments devoid of contaminants. A crucial part of the program is reacting to and resolving issues of building occupants about issues in their workplace.<p>
<p>. Prior to picking the installation area of air conditioning system, several main factors need to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems should not fall on the location of rest or work area. Secondly, there ought to not be any challenges en route of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the area of the properties as much as possible. The outside system should also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be effectively discharged outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop greatly. It is highly recommended to set up the air conditioning system systems in quickly available locations, for more maintenance during operation.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more challenging to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
