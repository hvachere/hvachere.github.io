<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
