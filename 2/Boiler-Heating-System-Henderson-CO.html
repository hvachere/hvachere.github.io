<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly might be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
<p>If you operate in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you might unwittingly bring lead into your house on your clothes or hands.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
