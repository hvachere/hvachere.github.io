<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Somis CA</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very thorough in describing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn supplied terrific customer care at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance jobs we may want to have carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were fantastic! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They met my needs entirely by offering an expert quote with options, without pushing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also without delay followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
