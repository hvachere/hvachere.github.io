<p>Immediate effects might appear after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are usually short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Signs of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise appear not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
