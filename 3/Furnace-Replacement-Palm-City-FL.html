If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
