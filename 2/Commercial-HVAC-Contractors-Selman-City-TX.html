<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside system.

Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
