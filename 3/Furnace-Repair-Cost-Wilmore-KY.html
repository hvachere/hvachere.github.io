<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow restriction will lower the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
