<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping maker to flow hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the flooring heat moved heat to other posts in the spaces, consisting of the human occupants.<p>
<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
