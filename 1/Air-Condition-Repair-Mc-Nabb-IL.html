<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event.

<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
