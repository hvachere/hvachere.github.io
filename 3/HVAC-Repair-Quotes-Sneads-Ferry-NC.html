<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>An excellent place to begin is to compare your oil or natural gas furnace age to the nationwide average. The average life span of heating systems in homes today is in between 16 and twenty years. You need to start shopping if your furnace is close to this age or older. Looking for a replacement furnace in an emergency does not allow time for you to make your best choice. Many people prefer to change their furnace as a planned home improvement rather than a panic replacement when your furnace is failing or has currently typical lifespan of a warm air furnace will vary based upon its operating environment, that's why it's important to have the system serviced frequently by a qualified technician. They will have the ability to properly assess the condition of the furnace and make any recommendations.<p>
