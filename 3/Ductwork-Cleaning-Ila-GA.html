<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
