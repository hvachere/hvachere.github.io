Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure.
