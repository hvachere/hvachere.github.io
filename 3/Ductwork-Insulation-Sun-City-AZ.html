<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>

This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like an area heater) with the very same amount of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
