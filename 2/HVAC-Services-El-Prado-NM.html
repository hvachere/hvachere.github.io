<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working.

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in El Prado NM</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
