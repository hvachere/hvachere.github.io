<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year.

Hope this assists.<p>
