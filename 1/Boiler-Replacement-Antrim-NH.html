<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Antrim New Hampshire</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Antrim NH</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the service technicians thought they just didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, especially if you live in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and replaced frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to. The heating & cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will worsen. Examining and changing the air filters is one of the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
