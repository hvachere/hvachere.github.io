<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor environmental quality") explains how inside air can affect a person's convenience, health, and capability to work.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
