<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
