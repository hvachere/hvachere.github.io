<p>Info offered in this security guide is based on existing clinical and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings continuously evolve as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the residents, products, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a structure are constantly communicating, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we might see a window as changing slightly with time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned, collects dirt once again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be progressing as a result of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down completely. By comparison, examining and changing a furnace filter can normally be done in simply a few minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
