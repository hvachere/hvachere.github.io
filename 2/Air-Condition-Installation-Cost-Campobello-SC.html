<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that best temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
