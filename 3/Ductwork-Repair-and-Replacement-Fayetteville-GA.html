Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months.

Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Fayetteville GA</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>This lacked a doubt the best and most rewarding service me and my better half have actually ever gotten. Most importantly the technicians shown up here precisely when they stated that they would. Their rates was straight in line with the level of service that was provided also, the service technicians discussed precisely what they were looking and doing for each step of the method while they were here. They also helped us set up a particular service strategy that in the long run will help us save cash.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be set up to provide threshold notifies. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your tracking devices to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to fix the circumstance right away.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our choices did an outstanding task in making certain we comprehended the benefits and drawbacks of each choice. The professionals who installed the brand-new system were professional and quick, while requiring time to make sure we understood how the new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
