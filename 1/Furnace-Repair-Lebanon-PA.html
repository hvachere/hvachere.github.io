<p>Even newer heaters less than five years old have been discovered as bad. Too many house owners are surprised to find out that their 'brand-new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger. In many cases it is due to bad furnace style, however in a lot of cases, it's from overlook.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
