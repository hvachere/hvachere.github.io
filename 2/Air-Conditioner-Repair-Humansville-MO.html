Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon celebrations.<p>
