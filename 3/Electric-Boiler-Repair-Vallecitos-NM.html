<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Vallecitos NM</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
