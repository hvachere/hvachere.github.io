<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
