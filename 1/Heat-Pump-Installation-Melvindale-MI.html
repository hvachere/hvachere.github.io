<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
