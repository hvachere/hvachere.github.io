<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Napa CA</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by utilizing clever innovation. Martin said the company can develop a dashboard within the structure's controls that will provide data on its systems to allow for real time visibility, providing the ability to be preventative instead of reactionary. This service can be supplied to any commercial customer, not simply throughout new building.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
