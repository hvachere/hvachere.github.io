<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
