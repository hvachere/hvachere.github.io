<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may see musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your medical professional about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
