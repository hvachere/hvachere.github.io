<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
