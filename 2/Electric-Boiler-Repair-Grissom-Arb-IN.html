Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities.

To detect odors in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
