<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.
