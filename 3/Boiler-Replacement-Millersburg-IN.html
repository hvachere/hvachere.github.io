<p>Geothermal heating is among the most effective heating sources in terms of environmental expenses. It protects the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or pollutants because the energy used to heat your house is drawn out directly from the ground.

<p>We look at hints before we supply recommendations to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
