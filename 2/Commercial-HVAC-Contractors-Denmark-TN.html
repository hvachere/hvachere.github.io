<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
