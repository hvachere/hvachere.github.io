<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
