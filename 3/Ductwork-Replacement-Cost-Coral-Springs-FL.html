Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
