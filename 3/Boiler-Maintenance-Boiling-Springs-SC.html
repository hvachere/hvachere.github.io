<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
