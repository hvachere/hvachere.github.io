<p>The primary health effect related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
