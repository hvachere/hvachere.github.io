<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
