<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one action stated the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of repeated usage of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.  an extremely advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
