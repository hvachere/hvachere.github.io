<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, since the total capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not easy, because it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
