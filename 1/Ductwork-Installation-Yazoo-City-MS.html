<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very useful in gathering details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
