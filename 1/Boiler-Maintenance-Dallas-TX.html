<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Dallas TX Home Owners</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using clever technology. Martin said the company can establish a control panel within the building's controls that will offer information on its systems to allow for actual time exposure, providing the capability to be preventative instead of reactionary. This service can be offered to any commercial customer, not just during new building.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
