<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>There are many actions a property owner can require to choose products that will prevent indoor air problems from happening - a number of them are pointed out here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about using strong wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an effective wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>
