<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
