<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
