<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
