<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product purchased with your home. This company presented a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the evaluation on a really cold day they killed the furnace declaring health risk reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new resident I have found out how to recognize the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Rye CO</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really delighted that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to check AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your investment by only using the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified agent from a company or merchant to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed person to do the work, in a lot of, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the a/c system. A voided guarantee won't do you any excellent ought to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the get-go and work with a licensed individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
