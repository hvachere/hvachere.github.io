<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
