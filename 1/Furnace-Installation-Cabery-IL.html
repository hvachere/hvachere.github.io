<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still required to have an expert technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
