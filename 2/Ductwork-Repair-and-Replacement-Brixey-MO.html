<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar.

<p>A customized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air course. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, since all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat energy is removed.
