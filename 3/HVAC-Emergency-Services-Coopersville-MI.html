<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Coopersville MI</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to assess circumstance & chose to opt for them for the work. I am happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked to from beginning to end were extremely expert, considerate and the work was very efficiently done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the issue and repaired really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my needs entirely by providing an expert quote with options, without pushing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the essential evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
