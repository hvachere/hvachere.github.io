Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a homeowner can require to choose items that will prevent indoor air problems from happening - a number of them are discussed here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about using strong wood items. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that an efficient moisture barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
