<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
