<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>
