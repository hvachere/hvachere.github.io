<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time.

I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
