<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
