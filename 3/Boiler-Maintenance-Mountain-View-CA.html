<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
