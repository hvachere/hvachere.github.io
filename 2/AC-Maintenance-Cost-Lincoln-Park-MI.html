<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is generally higher than numerous heatpump choices, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the design you buy. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating options. This suggests it can warm up your house to the desired temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
