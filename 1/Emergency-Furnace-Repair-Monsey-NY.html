<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Monsey NY</h3>
<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources may not present a substantial health risk by themselves, the majority of homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a severe danger from the cumulative effects of these sources. Thankfully, there are steps that most people can take both to lower the danger from existing sources and to prevent new problems from occurring. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to take actions that can reduce the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can likewise create particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square footage. They use a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs required to heat the area. The larger the space, the more powerful the house heating system needs to be. For currently constructed home heater, the contractor will need to eliminate the old furnace to include the brand-new one. These charges will be consisted of in the installation expenses.<p>

A home located in the South would need an AC system with a size capable of cooling your house due to high temperature Summers. A house in the Northern part of the US would require a much bigger heating capacity too which will affect costs.
