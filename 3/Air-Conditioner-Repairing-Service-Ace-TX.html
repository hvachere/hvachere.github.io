<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

Many attics are likewise being converted to complete bed rooms to include extra space. Spaces in the upper locations of houses are particularly prone to getting uneasy and incredibly hot throughout the summer season, making a/c a lot more needed.<p>
