<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years.

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
