<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at sensible energy expenses.

Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone.
