<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy effective techniques of heating or cooling a house. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a home can be heated up in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found just a couple of feet below ground. In the summer months, the procedure reverses, therefore cooling a house by getting rid of heat.

<p>Particular kinds of HVAC units are a little more expensive than wall systems, ceiling or cassette systems are neatly hidden inside the ceiling in the classroom and are for that reason more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to look at.

Ducted commercial-grade air conditioning systems are BETTER for the instructional environment.

<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

Producers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they detected the issue and repaired very quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
