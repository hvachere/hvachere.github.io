<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, people exhale carbon dioxide, which in little quantities is not hazardous, but might end up being harmful if high concentrations are enabled to build up. Germs or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the entire workplace or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
