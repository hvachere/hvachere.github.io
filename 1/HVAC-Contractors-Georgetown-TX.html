<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
