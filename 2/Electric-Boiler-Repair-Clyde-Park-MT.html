<h3>Residential HVAC in Clyde Park Montana</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings.
