<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
