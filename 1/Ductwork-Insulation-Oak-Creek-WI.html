<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%.
