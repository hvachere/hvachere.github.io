<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Eastlake OH</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install examination results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
