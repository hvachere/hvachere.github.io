They weren't cheap however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>
