<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the prospective to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to assess and, if necessary, update the building envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>The very first a/c unit and fridges employed poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
