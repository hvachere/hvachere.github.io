<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment in Charlestown IN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We picked getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has a possibility to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
