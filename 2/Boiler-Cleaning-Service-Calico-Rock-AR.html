<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils.

It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
