<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
