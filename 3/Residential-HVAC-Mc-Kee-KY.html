Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or placed in such a way that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Improperly situated outside air intake vents can also bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>

I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
