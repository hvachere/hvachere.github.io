Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside might cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Numerous elements affect IAQ. These factors consist of poor ventilation (lack of outdoors air), issues managing temperature level, low or high humidity, current improvement, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air entering into the building.
