<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
