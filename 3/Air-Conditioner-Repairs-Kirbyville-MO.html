<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
