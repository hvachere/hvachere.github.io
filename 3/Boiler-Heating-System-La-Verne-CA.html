<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up inspection outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
