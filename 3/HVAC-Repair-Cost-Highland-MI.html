<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those aiming to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
