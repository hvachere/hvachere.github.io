<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
