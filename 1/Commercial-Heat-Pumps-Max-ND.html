Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the needed electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures.

Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
