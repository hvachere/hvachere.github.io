<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.
