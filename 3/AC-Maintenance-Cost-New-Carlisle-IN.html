It might likewise include the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees each year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and normally some other advantages. Some companies offer top priority visits to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
