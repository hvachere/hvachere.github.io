<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limits utilize dose-response data which show the health results of repetitive direct exposure to one particular chemical. Similar information is not offered for long-lasting, low-level exposures to a mix of pollutants as is the case for IAQ issues. Currently, there is inadequate info readily available to predict the results of direct exposure to a number of potentially harmful agents at the same time.<p>

<p>Even if you don't feel unclean, pollen clings to your hair and clothing where it can quickly aggravate your nose and eyes, and contribute to indoor air contamination.

For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Since cooling and heating work may also require repairing or installing pipes to supply oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor may also be required to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a certified plumbing technician on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors specifically for this profession. When getting an estimate, make certain to ask not just if a company is licensed, but likewise what kind of license it holds.<p>
