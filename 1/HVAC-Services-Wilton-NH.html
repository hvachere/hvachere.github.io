<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Wilton NH Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>

I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
