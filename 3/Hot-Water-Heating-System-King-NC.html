<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
