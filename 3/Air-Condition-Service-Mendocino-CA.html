<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation.

While an area heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
