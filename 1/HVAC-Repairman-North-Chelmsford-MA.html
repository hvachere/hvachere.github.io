<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
