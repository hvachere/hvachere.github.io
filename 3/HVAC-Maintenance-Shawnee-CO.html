<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last floor surface. This is usually used in a third-floor or second location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
