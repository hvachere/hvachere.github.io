<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Harrison NY</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs entirely by offering an expert quote with options, without pressing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also promptly followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
