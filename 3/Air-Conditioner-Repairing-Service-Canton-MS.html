<p>Room a/c feature a thermostat sensing unit, located behind the control panel, which measures the temperature of air entering the evaporative coil.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Safe private removed cable televisions to the floor using little blobs of hot-melt glue. Carefully cut and eliminate the orange mesh to free the cable. Do this to work around obstacles, sections and angles where full-width mats won't fit. Do not overlap the cable. When the entire mat is fitted and installed, press it securely into the tape and hot-melt glue any loose ends or humps in the mat. Perform a resistance test to look for damage.<p>
