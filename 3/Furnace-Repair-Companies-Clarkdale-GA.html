<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
