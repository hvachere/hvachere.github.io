<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
