<h3>Which Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Logansport IN?</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on different house efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us debate which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's products and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the needed electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
