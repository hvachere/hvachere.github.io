<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up.

Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
