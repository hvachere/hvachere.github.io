<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Leander TX?</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post set up evaluation results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
