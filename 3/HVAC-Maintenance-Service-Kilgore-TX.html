He committed to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install examination results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
