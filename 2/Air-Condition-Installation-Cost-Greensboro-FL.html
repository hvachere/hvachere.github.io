<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is typically crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative must request that the company have air monitoring tests performed. Evaluation of this information might determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
