Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
