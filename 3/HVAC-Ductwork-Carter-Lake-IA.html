<p>You might choose to keep your service and item line simple for now if you're in the first couple of years of organisation.

<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company needs to check measurements of humidity, temperature and air flow. In addition, assessment and screening of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to make sure it is working according to requirements for building usage and occupancy) must be carried out. A structure walk-through to look for odors and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings may be practical. Leaks need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with bacteria or fungi and need to be eliminated, also. In some situations, specific testing for radon or for asbestos may be needed as part of building tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Danger Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Selecting the ideal size central air conditioning system for your home is very crucial, as is choosing either a bundle system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one system, or a split system, which places the condenser outside the fan and the house and coil within.
