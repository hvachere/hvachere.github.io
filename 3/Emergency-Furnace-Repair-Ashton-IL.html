<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
