<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item.

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately harden and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
