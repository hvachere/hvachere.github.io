<p>New air conditioning system usually vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER rating implies greater energy efficiency and possibly lower energy bills. An excellent SEER ranking for you depends on your house size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally enabled SEER score is going to be much more energy effective than your current, old air conditioner. It's not always about picking the design with the greatest SEER rating, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealership can assist.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
