However, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not basic, because it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
