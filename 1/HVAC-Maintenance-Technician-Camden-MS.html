<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they must be positioned. Many typically they are mounted at height-level or slightly lower, if individuals primarily stay seated in that particular area.

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are usually near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
