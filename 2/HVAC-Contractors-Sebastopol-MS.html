Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
