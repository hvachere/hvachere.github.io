<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
