<p>. Prior to picking the installation area of air conditioning unit, several primary factors require to be considered. First off, the instructions of air flow from the indoor systems should not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles on the way of the air flow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit needs to also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be efficiently released outside and the performance of the whole system will drop dramatically.
