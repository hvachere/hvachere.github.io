<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m really picky with my things. I like my equipment and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.

Itâ $ s simply perfect.<p>
