<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
