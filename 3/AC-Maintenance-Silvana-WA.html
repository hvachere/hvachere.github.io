<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
