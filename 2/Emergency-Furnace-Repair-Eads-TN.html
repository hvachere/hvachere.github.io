<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
