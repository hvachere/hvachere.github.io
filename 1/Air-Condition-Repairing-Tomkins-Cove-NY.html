For example, we might see a window as changing somewhat over time as it ends up being filthy, then is cleaned, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be evolving as a result of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the go to. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>
