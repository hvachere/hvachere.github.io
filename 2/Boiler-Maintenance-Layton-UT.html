<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically essential to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can often be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted.
