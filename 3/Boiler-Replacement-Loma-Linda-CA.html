<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Loma Linda CA</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively simple to determine surrogate for indoor pollutants released by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside might trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning unit and heat pump should be free of all blockages and particles. Clogs can obstruct the circulation of condensed water and cause wetness accumulation within the system. Excess moisture can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the residential or commercial property, irregular temperature level regulation, bacteria, and jeopardized air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to make sure all excess moisture flows away from the system.<p>
