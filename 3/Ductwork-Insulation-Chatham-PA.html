<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Chatham PA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
