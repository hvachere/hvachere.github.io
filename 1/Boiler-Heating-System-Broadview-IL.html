<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides more details on air-cleaning devices to minimize indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
