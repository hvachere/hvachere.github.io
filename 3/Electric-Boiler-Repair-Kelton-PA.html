<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electrical energy, a heat pump is a cost-efficient solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being blocked with debris that can limit airflow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By contrast, replacing a furnace and examining filter can generally be carried out in just a couple of minutes, typically without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
