<h3>Installation of HVAC in Virginville Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
