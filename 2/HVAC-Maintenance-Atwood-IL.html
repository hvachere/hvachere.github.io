Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
