<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
