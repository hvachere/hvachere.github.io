<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
