<p>As with most home improvement jobs, the cost of a full central heating system can vary extensively based upon the size of the home. Many furnaces will last in between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and efficiency.

A small home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and shut down for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
