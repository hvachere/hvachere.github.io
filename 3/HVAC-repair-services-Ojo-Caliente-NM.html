<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option in between the 2 types. Gas heating systems cost about the same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The genuine benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is allowed to flow and increase out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack result ), triggering cool outdoors air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can utilize very little energy, but care must be taken to guarantee comfort. In warm or humid climates, maintaining thermal convenience exclusively by means of natural ventilation might not be possible. A/c systems are utilized, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outside air when suitable.<p>
