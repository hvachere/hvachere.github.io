<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
