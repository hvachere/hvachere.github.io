<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
