<h3>Window Air Conditioner in South Houston TX</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have numerous control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control board should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t properly detected, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
