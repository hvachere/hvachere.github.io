<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may observe undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
