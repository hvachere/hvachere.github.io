<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Willow Spring NC</h3>

<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Willow Spring NC</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t appropriately identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
