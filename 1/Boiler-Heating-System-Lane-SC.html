<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit.

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
