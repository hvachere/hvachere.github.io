<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same.

Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly harden and cure-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
