Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfy temperature level.
