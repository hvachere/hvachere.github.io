<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
