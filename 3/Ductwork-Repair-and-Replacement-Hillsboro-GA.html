In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged.
