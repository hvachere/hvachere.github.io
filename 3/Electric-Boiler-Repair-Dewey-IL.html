<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.
