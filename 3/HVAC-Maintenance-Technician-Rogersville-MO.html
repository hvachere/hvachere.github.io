<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We selected getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenditures.
