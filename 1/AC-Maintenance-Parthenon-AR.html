<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
