<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be residing in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. However a number of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne pollutants in their houses and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>For instance, contaminants may gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing toxins into the environment.

Or the ventilation system may not be working as well as it must-- if debris is blocking the outdoor air consumption, for example, or the filters are polluted or inadequately maintained.<p>
