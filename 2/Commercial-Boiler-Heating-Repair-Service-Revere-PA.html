The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
