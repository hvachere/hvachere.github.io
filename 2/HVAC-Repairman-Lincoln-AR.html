<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with your house.

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern.
