<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate however a less effective collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can become obstructed with particles that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down totally. By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

A professional technician will check the thermostat during the annual maintenance to ensure the actual temperature level and the temperature on the thermostat matches. If there's a difference in the temperature level, the technician needs to check the thermostat's efficiency or assess the entire HVAC system.<p>
