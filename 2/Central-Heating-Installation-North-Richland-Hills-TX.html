<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from items or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
