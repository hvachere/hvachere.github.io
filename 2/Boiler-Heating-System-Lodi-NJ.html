<h3>Things to Look for When Hiring an Lodi NJ HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
