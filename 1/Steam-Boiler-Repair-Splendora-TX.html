<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Splendora TX</h3>

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
