<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Examine these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
