<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Elmira California</h3>
<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource area suggests that "Air Filtration must have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can reduce the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, saved fuels and paint supplies, and car emissions in attached garages. Actions that will minimize benzene exposure include removing smoking cigarettes within the house, providing for optimum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint products and special fuels that will not be used immediately.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the very same method as an automobile radiator or typical home ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
