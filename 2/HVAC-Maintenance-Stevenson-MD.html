<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
