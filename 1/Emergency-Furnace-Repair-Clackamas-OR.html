<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Clackamas OR Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
