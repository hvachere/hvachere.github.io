Permeable products, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and ought to be disposed of.

Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
