<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. Sometimes it's not a significant problem, and your system might just need some maintenance work.

<h3>HVAC System in Hope Mills North Carolina</h3>
<p>Every house and business owner has different heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) needs.

<p>A geothermal heater does not produce its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as coal, oil, or gas. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth. Furthermore, a geothermal cooling and heating system uses considerably less electricity compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heater an attractive solution to cut your carbon footprint, offering a positive influence on the environment.<p>
<p>We have been incredibly pleased with Integrity's devices (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has worked very well and is so effective that it significantly decreased our utility costs - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we have needed them for emergencies they responded rapidly and solved the problem.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively simple to determine surrogate for indoor pollutants given off by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity.

Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
