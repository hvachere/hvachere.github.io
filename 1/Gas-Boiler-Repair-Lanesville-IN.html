<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Things to Search for When Selecting an Lanesville IN HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
