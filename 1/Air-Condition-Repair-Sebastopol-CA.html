It safeguards the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or toxins due to the fact that the energy used to heat your home is drawn out directly from the ground. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems comparable to those utilized in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electrical energy, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
