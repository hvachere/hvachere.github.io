<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are readily available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Service! Climate Pro is dependable and genuinely appreciated us and our situation. We got back one night to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that exact same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might look for and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely thankful to have a heated home once again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right prior to a vacation, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
