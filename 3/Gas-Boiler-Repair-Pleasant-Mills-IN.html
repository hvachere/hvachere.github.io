Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been correctly dried. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
