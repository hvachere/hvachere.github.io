<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is frosty. Likewise, if the air conditioning system smells bad, there could be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat far from your home. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you set up, it's essential that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should.
