<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and filthy.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
