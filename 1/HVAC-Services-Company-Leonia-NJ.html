<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
