<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that best temperature level all year round.

Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road.

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants.

The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
