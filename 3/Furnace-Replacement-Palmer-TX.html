<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>The majority of well and city water does not usually consist of lead. Water typically picks up lead inside the house from home plumbing that is made with lead products. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water checked. Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and performance if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside ought to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
