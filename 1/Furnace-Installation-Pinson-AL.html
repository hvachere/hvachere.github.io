<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces direct exposure to contaminants during cooking. Inappropriate modification, typically indicated by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame idea is blue. Think about buying one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you purchase a new gas stove or range. Never use a gas stove to heat your home. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
