<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every four years. The Basics Handbook includes heating and cooling computations.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
