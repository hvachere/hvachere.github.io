During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Hardyville KY</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0.
