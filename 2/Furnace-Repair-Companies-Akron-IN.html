<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
<p>If your a/c is old, consider buying an energy-efficient design. Try to find the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central systems have to do with 15% more effective than standard models. New residential central air conditioner requirements entered into effect on January 1, 2015; see the performance requirements for central air conditioners for details, and think about purchasing a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for higher savings.<p>

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years back and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
