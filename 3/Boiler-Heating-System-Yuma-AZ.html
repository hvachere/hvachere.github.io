<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
