<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has actually been utilized frequently in a range of building construction products for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have banned a number of asbestos products. Makers have also voluntarily restricted usages of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most frequently discovered in older houses, in pipe and furnace insulation materials, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other covering materials, and floor tiles.<p>
<p>Throughout regular furnace operation, dust, dirt, wetness from humidity or condensation, and microbial developments can build up on internal elements.

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
