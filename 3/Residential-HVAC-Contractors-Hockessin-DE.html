<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally caused by the absence of adequate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the main problem in majority the office indoor air investigations it has performed. Examinations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the very same to be real. These examinations exposed that proper ventilation is necessary in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>

You might associate that lemony or piney scent with a tidy kitchen or clean synthetic scents in laundry items and air fresheners emit dozens of different chemicals into the air.
