<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
