Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are generally used in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and unclean.
