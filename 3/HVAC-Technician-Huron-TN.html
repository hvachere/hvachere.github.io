We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product with time.

Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
