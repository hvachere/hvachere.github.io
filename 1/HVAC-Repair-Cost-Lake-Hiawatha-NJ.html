<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits use dose-response data which show the health results of repeated direct exposure to one specific chemical. Comparable data is not offered for long-lasting, low-level direct exposures to a mix of impurities as holds true for IAQ issues. Presently, there is not enough details offered to forecast the results of exposure to several possibly damaging agents at the same time.<p>
