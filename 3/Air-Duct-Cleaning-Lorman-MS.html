<p>Nick B. provided remarkable, tailored, mindful, and quality service. His communication style gets along, engaging and reliable. He clearly and thoroughly explained all problems and fixes in a way that made me positive in his ability to fix my repair problems. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my other half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, during one of the coldest winters in current memory. He also responded to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to an issue that could not be resolved on the very first check out due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and capability to provide constant, quality service.<p>
