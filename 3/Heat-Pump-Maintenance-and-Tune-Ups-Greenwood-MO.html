<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide need to be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
