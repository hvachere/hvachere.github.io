<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
