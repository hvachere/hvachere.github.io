<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's ac system are more energy efficient than designs made even 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your system if it's five years old or older.

<h3>Passive Ventilation in Newell North Carolina</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
