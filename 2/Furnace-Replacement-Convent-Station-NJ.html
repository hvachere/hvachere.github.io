While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak effectiveness.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
