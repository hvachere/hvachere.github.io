<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently higher salaries for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or simply a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical wages for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
