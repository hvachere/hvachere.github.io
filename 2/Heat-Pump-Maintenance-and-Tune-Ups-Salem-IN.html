<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to outdoor or commercial settings.

Inadequate ventilation likewise takes place if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or put in such a method that outside air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Incorrectly located outdoor air intake vents can likewise bring in air polluted with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets.

<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Function in Salem IN</h3>
