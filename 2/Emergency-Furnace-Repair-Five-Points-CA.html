And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies each month could be utilized to help you pay for a new, much more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your recent heating costs with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a significant difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>
