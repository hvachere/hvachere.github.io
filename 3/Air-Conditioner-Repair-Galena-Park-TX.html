<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
