<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
