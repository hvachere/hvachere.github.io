After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency.

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
