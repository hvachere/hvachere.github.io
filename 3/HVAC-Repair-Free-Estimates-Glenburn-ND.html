<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
