<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher earnings for air conditioning tradespersons.

According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest typical salaries for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites should find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
