<h3>HVAC Emergency Services in Willard UT</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
