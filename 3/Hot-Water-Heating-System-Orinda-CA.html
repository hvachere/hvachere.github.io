<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about.

Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity.
