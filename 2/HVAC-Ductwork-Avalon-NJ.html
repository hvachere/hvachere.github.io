<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have multiple control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t correctly diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
