(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Through regular usage and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner may end up being very dirty.
