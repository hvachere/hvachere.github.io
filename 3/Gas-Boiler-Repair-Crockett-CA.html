<p>It's safe to presume that you currently have actually ductwork set up if you are replacing your current air conditioning system. Ductwork provides the conditioned air from your HVAC system throughout your home through vents frequently found in your house's attic and However, with time ductwork can lose its' effectiveness or may need to be altered to work with your new AC system.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
