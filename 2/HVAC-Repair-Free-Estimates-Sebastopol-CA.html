The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future.

<p>Some sources, such as developing products, home furnishings, and family products like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less constantly.

High contaminant concentrations can remain in the air for extended periods after a few of these activities.<p>
