<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Service in Hardy</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
