<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to offer adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
