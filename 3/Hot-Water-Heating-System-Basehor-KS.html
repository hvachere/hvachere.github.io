<h3>Repair and Care for Basehor KS Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Developed to improve producing process control in a printing plant, Carrier's development managed not just temperature but also humidity Provider utilized his knowledge of the heating of things with steam and reversed the procedure. Instead of sending out air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and consequently the amount of wetness in the air might be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the space controllable. The regulated temperature and humidity helped keep consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later on, Provider's technology was used to increase efficiency in the work environment, and The Provider A/c Company of America was formed to fulfill rising demand. With time, a/c came to be used to enhance comfort in homes and vehicles too.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
