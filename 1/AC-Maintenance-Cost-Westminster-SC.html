<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
