<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My spouse said that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have actually met in a long time.
