<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Harvard IL?</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<h3>Ductless AC System in Harvard IL</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
