Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
