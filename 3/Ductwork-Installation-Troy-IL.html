<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working.

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil change in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>

EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers throat, eye, and nose inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
