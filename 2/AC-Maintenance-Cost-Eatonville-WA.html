<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Eatonville WA Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is dirty or clogged Before trying to fix any problem, take some time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, examine the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, call a knowledgeable technician.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
