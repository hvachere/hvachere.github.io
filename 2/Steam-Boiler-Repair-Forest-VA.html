<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
