<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Outdoor impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outside air can be asthma triggers.
