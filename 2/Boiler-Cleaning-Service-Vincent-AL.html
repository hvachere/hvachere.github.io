When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air.

The radiators might be installed on walls or set up within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
