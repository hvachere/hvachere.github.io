<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
