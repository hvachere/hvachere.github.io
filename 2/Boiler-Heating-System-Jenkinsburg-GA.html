<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Jenkinsburg GA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling impact. The majority of ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for each system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
