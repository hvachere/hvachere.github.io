Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
