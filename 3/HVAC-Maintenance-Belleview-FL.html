<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
