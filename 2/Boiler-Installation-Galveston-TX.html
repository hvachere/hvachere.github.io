<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>

The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
