<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate.

As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
