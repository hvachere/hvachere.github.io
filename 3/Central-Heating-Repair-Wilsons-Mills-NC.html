<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had actually found the difficulty location in looking over the expense. He solved the concern in one day, had adjusted the bill to what I thought about reasonable before he recalled, knew what might have triggered the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not occur once again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
<p>My eldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
