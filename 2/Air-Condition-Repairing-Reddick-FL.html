<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
