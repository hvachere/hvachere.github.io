<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
