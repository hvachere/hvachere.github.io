<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
