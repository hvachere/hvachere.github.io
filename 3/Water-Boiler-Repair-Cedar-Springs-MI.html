<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
