I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again.

<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
