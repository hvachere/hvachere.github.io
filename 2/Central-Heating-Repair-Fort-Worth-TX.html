A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might see musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
