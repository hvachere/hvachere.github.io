<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts decades, given that it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>

She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
