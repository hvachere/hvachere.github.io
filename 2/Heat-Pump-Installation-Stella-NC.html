<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can likewise intensify indoor air quality problems.

<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) is an essential issue in correction centers. It can directly impact the health and comfort of correctional officers and prisoners. The United States Epa (EPA) fact sheet An Office Buildings Occupants Guide to Indoor Air Quality to assist worksites address numerous IAQ concerns using typically inexpensive and useful steps. The HITEC II Study research study team has customized the EPA reality sheet for usage in corrections within this area.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
