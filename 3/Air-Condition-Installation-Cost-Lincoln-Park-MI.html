The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future.

Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
