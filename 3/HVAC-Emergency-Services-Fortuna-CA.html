<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have.
