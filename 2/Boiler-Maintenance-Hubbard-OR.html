<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Hubbard OR</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological pollutants are wet or damp structure products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and poorly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness brought on by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Various fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are pets and home plants.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater due to the fact that the service technicians believed they just didn't appear ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
