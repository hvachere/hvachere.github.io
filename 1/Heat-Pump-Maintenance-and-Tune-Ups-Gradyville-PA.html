<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to buy it. My spouse said that she had seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good people I have satisfied in a long period of time. If we want to have options to ACME heating, we need to support the real individuals who are there for us. Please do.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
