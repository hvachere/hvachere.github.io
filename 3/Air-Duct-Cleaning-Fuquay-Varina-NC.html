Likewise, real estate prices in Seattle have skyrocketed, and as an outcome, newer houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bedrooms on the upper levels. Many attics are also being transformed to finished bed rooms to add extra space. Spaces in the upper locations of homes are specifically vulnerable to getting unpleasant and extremely hot throughout the summertime, making cooling much more required.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature throughout the year.

Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which normally includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
