Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
