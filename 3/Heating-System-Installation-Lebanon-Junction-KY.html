<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
