While you can definitely buy your furnace yourself, many contractors will not warranty the furnace or might not install it if you don't purchase it from them. Installation costs vary throughout the county, but start at roughly $50 per hour up to $150 or more. It takes roughly 5 hours to set up a small furnace and more to set up a big one.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, expert and effectively done. The installers were respectful and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize quickly people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss out on detail that produces a job extremely well done.
