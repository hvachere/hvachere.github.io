<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works however your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Parkton MD - The Benefits</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My other half stated that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good people I have actually met in a very long time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by just using the services of a certified contractor or a qualified agent from a service or retailer to do the installation. If you pick to try to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed individual to do the work, in most, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the air conditioning system. A voided service warranty will not do you any good should the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the outset and hire a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
