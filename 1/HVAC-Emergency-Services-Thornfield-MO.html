<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Thornfield Missouri</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep.

If the air conditioning service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
