<p>Air pollutants can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are generally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
