<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
