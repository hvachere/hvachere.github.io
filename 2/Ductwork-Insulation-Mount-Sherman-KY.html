<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
