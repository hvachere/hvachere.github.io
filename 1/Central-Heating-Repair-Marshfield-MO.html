<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
