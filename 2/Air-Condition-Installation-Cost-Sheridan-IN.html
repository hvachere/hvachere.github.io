Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
