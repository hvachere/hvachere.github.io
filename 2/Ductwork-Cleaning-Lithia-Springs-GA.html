<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Lithia Springs GA</h3>

<h3>AC Maintenance in Lithia Springs GA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
