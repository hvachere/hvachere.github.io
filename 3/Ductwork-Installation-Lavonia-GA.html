Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high indoors might trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
