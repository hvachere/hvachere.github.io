<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain toxic substances (mycotoxins). However, exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in most cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores.

<p>It is not advised that "routine" occupational exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to identify if the basic indoor air quality satisfies a particular requirement. Occupational direct exposure limitations noted in health and safety guidelines and the Limit Limit Values ® (TLVs) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to prevent disease or specific effects (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial circumstances. These limitations might not be appropriate in workplace settings or for the home.<p>
