<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate scenario & decided to go with them for the work. I enjoy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from starting to end were extremely expert, courteous and the work was very effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Mobile houses are typically smaller sized than stick-built homes and use substantially less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat. Expect the typical mobile home oil furnace to have starting expenses of around $1,500. Keep in mind that not as many brands produce oil furnaces for this use, and you may find more options with gas, propane, or electric heating systems.<p>
