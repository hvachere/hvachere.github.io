HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio.
