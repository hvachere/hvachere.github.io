<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and harden-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
