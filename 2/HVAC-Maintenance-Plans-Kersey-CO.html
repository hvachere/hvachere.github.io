<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
