<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
