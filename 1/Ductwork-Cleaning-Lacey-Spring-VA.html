<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<h3>Floor Heating System in Lacey Spring VA</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Our technicians are trained, experienced and licensed to set up, keep and repair commercial and residential ventilation, air and heating conditioning equipment and to clean and examine your chimney or ventilation shaft. Our group does exceptional work, whether it's managing standard HVAC work or handling the peculiarities of brownstones, prewar buildings and other structures hard to heat or cool.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
