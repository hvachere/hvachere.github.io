<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
