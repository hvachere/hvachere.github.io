<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
