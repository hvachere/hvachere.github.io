Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
