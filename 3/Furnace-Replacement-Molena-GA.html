<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Your Evaluation This is my third time utilizing Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is proficient with these devices). I have nothing but fantastic things to say - he has taken good care of my heating and AC needs. Quick reaction - fast resolution.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, humans breathe out carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not harmful, however might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to collect. Micro-organisms or germs may also exist within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the whole work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
