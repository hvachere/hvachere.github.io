<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is designed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts interested in indoor air quality. Our specialists describe all of your choices before beginning the repair, so you can choose whether a repair or replacement is best for you. Our No Surprises Pricing-- including charging by the task, not by the hour-- suggests the price we estimate you is the cost you pay. If you decide that replacing your furnace is the best course of action, we can set up a new, high-efficiency model in its location.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can take full advantage of effectiveness and offer longer long lasting house heating. However, there are times when a basic maintenance call can recognize a problem that will require a considerable financial investment to remedy. Then, it's decision time. Do you make the expensive repair and enjoy ongoing comfort from your current heater? Or, do you make an even bigger financial dedication to changing the furnace? The decision to change or repair is up to you, and often it refers comparing the cost to repair, taking into account the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely offers higher energy efficiency and includes warranty protection.<p>
