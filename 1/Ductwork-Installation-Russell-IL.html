<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
