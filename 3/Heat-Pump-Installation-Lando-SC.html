Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Switch off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2).
