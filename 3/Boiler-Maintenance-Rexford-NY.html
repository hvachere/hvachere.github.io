<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and efficiency if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
