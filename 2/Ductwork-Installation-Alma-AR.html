<h3>Heat Pump Prices in Alma AR</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
