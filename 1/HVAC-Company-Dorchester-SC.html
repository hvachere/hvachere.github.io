These consist of chemicals utilized in the building and construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate items of incomplete combustion.
