<p>Chemical toxins: Unstable organic substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the building (e.g., office devices; wall, furniture and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers throat, eye, and nose irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort.
