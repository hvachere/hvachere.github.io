<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
