<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or ac system do not just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repeated usage of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early deterioration, leading to fractures and holes. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. a very helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
