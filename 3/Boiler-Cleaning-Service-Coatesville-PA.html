<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, because the unit is combined.
