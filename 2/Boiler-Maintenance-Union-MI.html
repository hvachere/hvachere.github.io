<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter can worsen problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your home.

<p>Its distinct feature is the presence of one primary external system that linked to several indoor systems.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
