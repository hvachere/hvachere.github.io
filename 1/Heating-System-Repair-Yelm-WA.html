<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
