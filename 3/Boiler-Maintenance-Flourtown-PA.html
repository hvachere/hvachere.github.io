They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
