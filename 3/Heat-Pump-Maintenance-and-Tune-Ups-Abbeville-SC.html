<p>Terrific Item! Delivery was kind of unusual being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we solved concerns. I would advise this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time.
