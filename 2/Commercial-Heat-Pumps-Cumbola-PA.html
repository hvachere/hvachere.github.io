<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out.

<h3>Locating Best HVAC Contractors in Cumbola PA</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also needs to be in top condition for the a/c to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the house. The technician can examine the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or excessive dirt if the individual parts are in appropriate order. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler house in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
