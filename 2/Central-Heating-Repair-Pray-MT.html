<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, a lot of Seattleites should find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

While an area heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
