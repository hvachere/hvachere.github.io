<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will frequently build up in ductwork, limiting air flow. Considering that ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem very challenging initially, requiring specialized tools, devices, and knowledge.

<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource area suggests that "Air Filtration ought to have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are utilized to reduce the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can act as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can decrease the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>Some health results might appear shortly after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are treatable and usually short-term. Often the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma may appear, be aggravated or aggravated.<p>
