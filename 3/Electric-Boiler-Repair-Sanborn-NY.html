<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
