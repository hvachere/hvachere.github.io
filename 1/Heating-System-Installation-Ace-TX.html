<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy required for heating & cooling.

(See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.)

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Consider potential results of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the manufacturer's directions, particularly directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
