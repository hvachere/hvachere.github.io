The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power ought to not surpass the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a very comfy temperature level.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency.
