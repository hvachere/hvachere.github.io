<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately treat and harden-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat.
