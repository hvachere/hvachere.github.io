<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating system appears less like a luxury item and more like a necessity. (Besides, heated floors were good enough for the Roman Empire) However prior to you dedicate to what can be a major improvement project, it's finest to ask yourself whether a glowing floor heater is a suitable option for your specific house heating needs.<p>
