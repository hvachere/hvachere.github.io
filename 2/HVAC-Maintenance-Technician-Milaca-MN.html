<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).

The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
