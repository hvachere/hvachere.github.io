<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Solo MO</h3>
<p>Sean was really useful. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
