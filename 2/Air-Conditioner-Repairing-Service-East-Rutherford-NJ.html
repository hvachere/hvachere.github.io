<p>Immediate results may appear after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to supply sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
