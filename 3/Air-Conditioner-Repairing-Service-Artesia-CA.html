<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Artesia CA</h3>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
