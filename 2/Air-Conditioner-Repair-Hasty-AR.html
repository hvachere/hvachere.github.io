<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000.

<p>Air toxins can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older homes might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to change the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor unit. Nevertheless, thinking about recent changes in refrigerants and a/c designs, it may be wiser to replace the entire system.<p>
