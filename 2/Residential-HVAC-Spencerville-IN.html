<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Spencerville IN</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air assists and waters down indoor impurities exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
