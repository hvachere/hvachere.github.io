<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
