<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in gathering info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>

Ilan always makes himself offered - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is knowledgeable with these devices).

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was 6 months prior to the current one expired. She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
