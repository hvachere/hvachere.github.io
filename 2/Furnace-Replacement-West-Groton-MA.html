<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air might also be a problem when ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the variety of employees in the location.<p>
<p>When installing the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one included excavation, running hundreds of backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is quite costly. Setting up a new geothermal heat pump to deal with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>
<p>There's no escaping that all devices ages with time. However that doesn't suggest that older chillers can not benefit from mechanical upgrades. We provide a wide variety of modernization, retrofit and update options for lots of devices types.
