An air contaminant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care items. Infections and bacteria, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
