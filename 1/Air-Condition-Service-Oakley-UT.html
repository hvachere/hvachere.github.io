<p>Brian was every bit sincere, enjoyable and responsive.

<p>My eldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnÃ¢ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t actually consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itÃ¢ $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
