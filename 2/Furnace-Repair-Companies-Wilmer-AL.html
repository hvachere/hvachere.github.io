<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size.
