<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Calimesa CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the technicians believed they just didn't seem right and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
