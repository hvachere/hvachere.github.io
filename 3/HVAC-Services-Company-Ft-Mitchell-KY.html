<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a referral later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose irritation.
