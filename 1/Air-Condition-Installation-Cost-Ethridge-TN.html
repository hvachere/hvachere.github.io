<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having fixed the issue with a simple repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Place control involves moving the toxin source away from residents or even transferring vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE scores often feature higher price tags.
