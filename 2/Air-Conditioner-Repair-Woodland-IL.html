<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends on numerous factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions.

Poorly located outdoor air intake vents can also generate air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
