<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Colorado City CO</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
