<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems at Cumberland NC</h3>
<p>Everybody deal with a variety of dangers to our health as we go about our everyday lives. Driving in vehicles, flying in airplanes, participating in leisure activities, and being exposed to environmental pollutants all position differing degrees of threat. Some dangers are just inescapable. Some we select to accept because to do otherwise would limit our capability to lead our lives the way we desire. And some are threats we might decide to prevent if we had the opportunity to make educated options. Indoor air pollution is one threat that you can do something about.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
