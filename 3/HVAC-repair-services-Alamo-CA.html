<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space.
