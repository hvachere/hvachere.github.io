<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Many AC units come with a variety of unique functions that can further enhance efficiency and effectiveness.
