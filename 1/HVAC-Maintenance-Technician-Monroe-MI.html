<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
