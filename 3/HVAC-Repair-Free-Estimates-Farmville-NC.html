<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
