<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
