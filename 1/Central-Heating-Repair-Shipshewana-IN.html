<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
