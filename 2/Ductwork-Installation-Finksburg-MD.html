Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
