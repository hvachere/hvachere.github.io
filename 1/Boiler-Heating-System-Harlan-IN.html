<p>Spot Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans need to be installed in all bathrooms and kitchens. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide. The most effective fans are resilient and peaceful. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to make sure the fans run for an adequate period of time. A great rule of thumb is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
