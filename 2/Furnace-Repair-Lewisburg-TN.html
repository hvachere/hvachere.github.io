<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative must ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests performed. Review of this data might recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
