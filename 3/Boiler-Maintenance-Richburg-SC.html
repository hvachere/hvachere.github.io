<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Richburg SC</h3>
<p>In-floor heating systems can feature specific health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you simply can't appear to heat up and discover you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this concern due to the fact that they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Furthermore, since they do not trust fans, ducts, returns and registers to distribute hot air, in-floor heating systems can lower the amount of dust and seasonal irritants in your house.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
