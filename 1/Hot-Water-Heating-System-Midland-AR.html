<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air may likewise be an issue when ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of workers in the area.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Atmospheric pressure distinctions developed by these forces move airborne contaminants from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any offered opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move till the within pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>
<p>EPA's Total Exposure Evaluation Methodology (GROUP) studies found levels of about a lots typical natural pollutants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were found in rural or extremely commercial areas. Additional TEAM research studies show that while people are using items containing natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high contaminant levels, and raised concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is completed.<p>

<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores circulating through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to toss open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is very important to be familiar with some of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that might be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
