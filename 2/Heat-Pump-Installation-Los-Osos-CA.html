<p>Sometimes, nevertheless, developing occupants experience symptoms that do not fit the pattern of any particular disease and are challenging to trace to any particular phenomenon has actually been labeled ill structure syndrome. Individuals might complain of one or more of the following symptoms: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; runny or stuffy nose; tiredness or lethargy; headache; lightheadedness; nausea; irritation and lapse of memory.
