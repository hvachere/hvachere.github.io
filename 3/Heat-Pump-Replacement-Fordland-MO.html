<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are related to exposure to toxic substances from bacteria that can grow in big building ventilation systems.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
