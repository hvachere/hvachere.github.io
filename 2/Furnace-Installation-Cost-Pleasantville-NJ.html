<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, babies, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults given that lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Children might have greater exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
