<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Many typical structure products utilized before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Typically, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing products is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the elimination process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit. Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since a system is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
