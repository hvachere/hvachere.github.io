Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power.

<h3>AC Maintenance in Milliken CO</h3>
<p>Central air units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Our technicians are trained, experienced and licensed to set up, maintain and repair commercial and residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning devices and to clean and inspect your chimney or ventilation shaft. Our team does outstanding work, whether it's dealing with conventional HVAC work or dealing with the quirks of brownstones, other structures and prewar buildings challenging to heat or cool.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
