<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace specialists frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

R-600 (isobutane) is already widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>
