<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
