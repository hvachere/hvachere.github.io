<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
