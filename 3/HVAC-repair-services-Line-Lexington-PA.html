<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
