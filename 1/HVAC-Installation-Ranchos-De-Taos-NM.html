<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, expert and effectively done. The installers were polite and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize quickly individuals who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are excellent and do not miss out on information that creates a job effectively done. I extremely highly recommend the 2 gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>
