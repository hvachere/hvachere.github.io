<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Many individuals are becoming more aware and concerned about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of irritants and toxins can cover the air conditioning ductwork with time. Occasionally it should be removed to refresh the quality and improve of indoor air and improve the cooling. Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans up the duct physically by removing the particles from the air filter.<p>
