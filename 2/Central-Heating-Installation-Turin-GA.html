<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>A specific air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the exact same air course. A standard ac system transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
