<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a really pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
