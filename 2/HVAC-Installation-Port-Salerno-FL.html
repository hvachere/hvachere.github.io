<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>

She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
