Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the beginning. But then recognized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes.
