<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace because it's the most common heater in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
