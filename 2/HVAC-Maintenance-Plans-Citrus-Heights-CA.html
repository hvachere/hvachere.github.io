<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly uncommon now.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
