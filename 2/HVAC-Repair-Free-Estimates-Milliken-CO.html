<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Milliken CO</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for years for my services, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is truthful, trustworthy, and affordable on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
