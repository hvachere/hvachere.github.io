<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best option for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
