The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>Central Heating Repair in Norwood New Jersey</h3>

This can be done through central heating Such a system contains a heat, furnace, or boiler pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central place such as a furnace space in a house, or a mechanical space in a large building.
