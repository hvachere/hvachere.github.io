<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Ferndale PA?</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
