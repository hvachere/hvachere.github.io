<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is wintry. Likewise, if the a/c unit smells bad, there could be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil absorbs the heat far from your home. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioner's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality specialists can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To decrease contaminants, we recommend installing sophisticated air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are designed to get rid of the tiniest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems also help control germs and natural smells. The majority of store-bought filters can not remove these smallest of allergens and don't remove germs and gases.<p>
<p>You might upgrade to the highest performance equipment offered and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The average house's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air gets away the system.<p>
