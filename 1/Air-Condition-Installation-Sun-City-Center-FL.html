<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
