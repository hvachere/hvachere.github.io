<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heatpump innovations are offered to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Client Service!

Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated home once again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right prior to a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my friends.<p>

The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Lawrenceburg IN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
