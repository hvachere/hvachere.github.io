<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
