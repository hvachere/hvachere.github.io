<p>A matched system is the mix of products that comprise your HVAC system. Depending upon your area, a matched system can be composed of the following: an air conditioner and furnace, a heat pump and furnace, a heat pump and air handler, an air conditioner and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system. By combining elements that are made to work perfectly together, you can produce a more effective ideal system.<p>

Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be deadly). Symptoms of these illness do disappoint up till many years after direct exposure started. Most people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothes and devices brought house from task websites.<p>
