<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
