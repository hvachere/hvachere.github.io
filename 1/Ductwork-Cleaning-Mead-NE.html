<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing product acquired with your house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health danger factor and contractor laws for their decision.
