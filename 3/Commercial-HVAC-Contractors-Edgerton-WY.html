VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>

In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated problems-- determined by consistently undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will require a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, among the three strategies below might be proper.<p>
