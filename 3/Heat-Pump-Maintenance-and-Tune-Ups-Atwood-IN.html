<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the unit. Loose, missing or faulty wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves inspecting the advised connections as well as temperature level and pressure gauges. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are tight and protected.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
