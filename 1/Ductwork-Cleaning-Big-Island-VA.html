<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
