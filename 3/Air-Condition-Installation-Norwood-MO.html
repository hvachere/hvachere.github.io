<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to outside or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might likewise consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
