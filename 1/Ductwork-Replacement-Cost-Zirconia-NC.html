<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that ideal temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service strategy which typically includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
