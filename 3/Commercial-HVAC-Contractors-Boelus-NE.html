<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
