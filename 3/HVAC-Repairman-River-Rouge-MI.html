<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in River Rouge Michigan</h3>
<p>If no contaminant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stale air might also be an issue when ventilation is not enough to represent an increase in the number of workers in the area.<p>
<p>Many people do not realize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break over time. That can jeopardize the performance of the system and ultimately damage it enough that you need to purchase furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will carefully examine the connections and assess the performance of the system. They'll try to find frayed and harmed wires and replace them in order to reduce the risk of fire and part failure.<p>
<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales man concerns your home he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and ought to not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the options for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.
