<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
