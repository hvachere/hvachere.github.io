<h3>AC Duct Repair in Ruth Mississippi</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
