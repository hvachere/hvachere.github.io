<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
