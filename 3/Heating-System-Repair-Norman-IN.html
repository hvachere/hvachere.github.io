<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
