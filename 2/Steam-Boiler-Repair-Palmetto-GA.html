With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its capabilities, allowing an improved value proposition for a more comprehensive set of clients.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified representative from an organisation or seller to do the installation.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
