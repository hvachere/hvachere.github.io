<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are many other pollutants that can not only filthy up the air, but cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (volatile natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the roadway.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
