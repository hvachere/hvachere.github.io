<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
