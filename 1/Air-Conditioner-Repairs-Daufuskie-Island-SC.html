<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
