Taylor took sufficient time to assist us debate which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings.

That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
