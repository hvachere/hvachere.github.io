<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure reality that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is just as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will frequently develop in ductwork, limiting air flow.

<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution.

When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide sufficient changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
