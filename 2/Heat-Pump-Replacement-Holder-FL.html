<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent location to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not troubled with it!

The radiators might be installed on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
