<p>There are 2 main forms of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the home heating business. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to resist present, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy.
