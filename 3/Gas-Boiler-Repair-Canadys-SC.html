<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.

When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Energy effectiveness can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater.

Momentarily increasing ventilation combined with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be useful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
