Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
