<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
