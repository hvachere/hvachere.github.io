<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
