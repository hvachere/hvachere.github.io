<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally caused by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which results in an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in majority the work environment indoor air investigations it has carried out. Examinations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the exact same to be true. These examinations exposed that proper ventilation is important in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the skills or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician examine the system periodically.<p>
