<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely extensive in describing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied fantastic client service at the end of the visit by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater.
