<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with the house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the assessment on a really cold day they killed the furnace declaring health threat reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new property owner I have actually learned how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
