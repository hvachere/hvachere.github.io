<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
