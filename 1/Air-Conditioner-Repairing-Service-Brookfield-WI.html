<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve cash over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as standard air-source systems. The absence of moving parts means you're less likely to invest huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
