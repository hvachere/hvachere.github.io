<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
