Inappropriate adjustment, often indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you acquire a new gas stove or range, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot burner that burns constantly. Never ever use a gas range to heat your house. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
