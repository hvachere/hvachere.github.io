Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
