<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Holden LA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
