<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a reliable and simple technique to minimize ambient air contamination and prospective health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
