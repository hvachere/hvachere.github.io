<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (expressed as a portion efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two.
