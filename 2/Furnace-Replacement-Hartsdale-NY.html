<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as essential when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to effectively cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
