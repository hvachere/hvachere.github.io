<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider potential impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's directions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater correctly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
