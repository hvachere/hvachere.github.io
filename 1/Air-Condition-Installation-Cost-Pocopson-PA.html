<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
