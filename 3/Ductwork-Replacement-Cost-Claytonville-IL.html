<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Claytonville IL</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
