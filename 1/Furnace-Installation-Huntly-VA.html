Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair.
