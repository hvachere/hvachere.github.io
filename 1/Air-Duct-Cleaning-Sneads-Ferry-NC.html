A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
