Therefore, making sure the air is of good quality is the company's task.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
