<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis.

A carefully crafted business plan for an HVAC company is the initial step to handle those peaks and lulls so your revenues remain healthy year-round.

<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in homes through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings build up inside your home, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>
