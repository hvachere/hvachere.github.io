<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when buying an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window.

<p>Sometimes a momentary indoor air quality issue is developed merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more intricate issues-- determined by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, among the three techniques listed below may be suitable.<p>
