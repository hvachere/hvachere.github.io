The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
