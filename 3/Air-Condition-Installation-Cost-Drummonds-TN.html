<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.
