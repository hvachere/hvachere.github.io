<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
