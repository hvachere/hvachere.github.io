<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
