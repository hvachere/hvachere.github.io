<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
