<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-lived indoor air quality problem is produced merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complex issues-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, among the three techniques listed below might be suitable.<p>
