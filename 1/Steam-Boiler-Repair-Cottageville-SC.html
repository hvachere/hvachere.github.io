<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Numerous common structure materials used prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Elimination of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the removal process. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is frequently advised instead.<p>
