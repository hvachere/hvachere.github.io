<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
