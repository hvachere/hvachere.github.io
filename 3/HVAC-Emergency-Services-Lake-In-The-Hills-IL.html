<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
