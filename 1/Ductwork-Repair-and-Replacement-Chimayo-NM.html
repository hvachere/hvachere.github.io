<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
