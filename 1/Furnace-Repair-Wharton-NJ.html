Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to make sure the fans run for a sufficient period of time.

<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
