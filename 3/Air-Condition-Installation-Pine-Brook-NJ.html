<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
