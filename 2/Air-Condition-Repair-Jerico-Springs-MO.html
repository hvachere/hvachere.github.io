<p>Some biological contaminants activate allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Transmittable illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing contaminants.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to supply enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
