<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>

High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
