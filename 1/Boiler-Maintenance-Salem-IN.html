<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Plan on spending numerous thousand dollars for the complete system if you are considering setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your home. The size of the system determines the labor hours involved to build the system. When you think about installation costs upwards of $50 per hour, to equip a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand name brand-new furnace or more.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many utilize the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a much better service. If the current system has not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and treated, repairing the system can make a lot of sense also.<p>
