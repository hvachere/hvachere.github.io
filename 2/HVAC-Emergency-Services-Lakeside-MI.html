I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is honest, reliable, and reasonable on price. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater wages for air conditioning tradesmen.

According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical salaries for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

Dust and dirt including allergens and contaminants can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Periodically it must be removed to revitalize the quality and improve of indoor air and enhance the cooling. Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans up the air ducts physically by getting rid of the particles from the air filter.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is typically essential to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can in some cases be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might determine potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, monitoring information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
