He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
