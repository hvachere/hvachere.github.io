<p>Sometimes, nevertheless, developing occupants experience symptoms that do not fit the pattern of any particular disease and are challenging to trace to any particular phenomenon has actually been labeled ill structure syndrome. Individuals might complain of one or more of the following symptoms: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; runny or stuffy nose; tiredness or lethargy; headache; lightheadedness; nausea; irritation and lapse of memory.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
