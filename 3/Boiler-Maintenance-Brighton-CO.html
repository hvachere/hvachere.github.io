<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
