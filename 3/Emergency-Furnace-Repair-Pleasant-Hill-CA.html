<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
