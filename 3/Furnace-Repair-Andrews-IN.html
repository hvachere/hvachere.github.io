While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
