<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
