<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
