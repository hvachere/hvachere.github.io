Loose, missing or defective wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes checking the advised connections along with temperature and pressure evaluates. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are safe and secure and tight.<p>
