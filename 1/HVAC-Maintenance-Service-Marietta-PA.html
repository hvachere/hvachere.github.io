<p>The most underrated HVAC element in your a/c system is the evaporator & condenser coil.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
