Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
