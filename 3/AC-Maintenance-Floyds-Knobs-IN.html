<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are less common now than gas, however they can be useful in more remote regions where energies are harder to gain access to, and in chillier climates since it offers more heat per BTU than other services.

They need a tank on the immediate home and more maintenance. In general, they cost in between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up. Overall, they supply an AFUE ranking of in between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
