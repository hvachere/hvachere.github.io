After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency.

In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common approach of lowering exposure to indoor air toxins, also will decrease but not get rid of direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke.

In addition, the large increases in ventilation it requires to significantly reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses considerably. Subsequently, the most efficient method to decrease direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of cigarette smoking there.<p>
