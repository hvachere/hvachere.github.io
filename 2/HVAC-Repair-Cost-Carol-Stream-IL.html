<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues.

Kids may have greater exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
