<h2>How To Hire HVAC Company in Bend</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your a/c unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Simply adding refrigerant is not an option if it leaks. An experienced technician should fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and effectiveness of your ac system is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
