<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in location. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of recurring use of a part that runs out balance.
