<h3>Things Every Homeowner Knows About Selecting Clarksville MD HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by licensed HVAC professionals. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>
