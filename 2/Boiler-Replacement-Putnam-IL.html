While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have a professional technician check the system occasionally.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you whenever they pertain to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months prior to the present one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
