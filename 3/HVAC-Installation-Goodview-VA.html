There are numerous style methods in usage today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with similar concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface area systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heatpump operate on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
