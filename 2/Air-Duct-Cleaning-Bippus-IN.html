These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0.
