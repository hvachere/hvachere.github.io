<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
