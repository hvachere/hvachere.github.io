<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
