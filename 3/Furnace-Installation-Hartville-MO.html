<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
