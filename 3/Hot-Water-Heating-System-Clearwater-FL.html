<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. Many home heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
