<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " primary ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Given that the 1980s, producers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they produce more efficient. This was originally driven by increasing energy costs, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological problems. Furthermore, improvements to the HVAC system performance can also help increase resident health and efficiency. 21 In the United States, the EPA has imposed tighter limitations for many years. There are several methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
