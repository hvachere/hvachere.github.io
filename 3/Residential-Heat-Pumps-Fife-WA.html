<p>The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon private sensitivity, which differs significantly from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>

<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
