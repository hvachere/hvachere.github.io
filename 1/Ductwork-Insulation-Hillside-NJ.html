And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
