<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
