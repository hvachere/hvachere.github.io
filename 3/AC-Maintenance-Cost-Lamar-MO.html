This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which reside inside the home.

Sealing leaks in ductwork can enhance HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler house in the hot summer season.<p>

<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Lamar MO</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
