<p>If your a/c unit is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the expense, unless it's a basic problem like particles obstructing the condenser system or a worn fan belt.

<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Virginia Beach VA</h3>
<p>For entire house setups, it's difficult, if almost impossible, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing home, especially a hydronic system. Localized glowing flooring heat systems to be used in one or a number of spaces like bathrooms, cooking areas or laundry rooms are easily refurbished with electric radiant flooring heat. This is far more cost-effective on a smaller scale. Bigger remodellings like additions to a home may be suitable for a larger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. Squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler generally happen when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. For the most part, the belt is improperly aligned or worn and requires replacement. Follow the guidelines above under A/c Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>
