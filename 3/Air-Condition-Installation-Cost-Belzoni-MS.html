<p>You could update to the greatest performance gear available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air system.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
