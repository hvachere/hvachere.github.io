<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
