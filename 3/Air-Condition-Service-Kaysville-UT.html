<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and harden-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
