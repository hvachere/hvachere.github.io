<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heatpump are excellent for additions due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
