<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my services, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he assisted me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>There is no simple answer, however many use the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a much better option. If the present system has actually not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
