<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service strategy which generally includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place. Moreover, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  a really beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
