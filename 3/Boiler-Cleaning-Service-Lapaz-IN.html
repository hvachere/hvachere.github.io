<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
