<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside.

Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>When attempting to figure out how typically I should change my air conditioning filters, there are lots of things to take into factor to consider. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a special DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how typically your air conditioning filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better ideal choice on how frequently your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one air conditioning filter need changing more often.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
