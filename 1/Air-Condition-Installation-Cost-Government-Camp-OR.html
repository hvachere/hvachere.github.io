<h3>Electric Furnace in Government Camp OR</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
