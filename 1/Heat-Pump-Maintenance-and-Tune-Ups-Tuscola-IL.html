<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electricity to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual rooms.
