<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
