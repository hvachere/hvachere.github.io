<p>We look at hints prior to we offer recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating system. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>The primary reason homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services provided.
