They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
