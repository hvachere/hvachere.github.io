<h3>Heating Contractors in Puckett MS</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
