<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of home heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of houses in cooler environments were warmed by convection, instead of radiation.

In turn, the things in the room, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
