<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
