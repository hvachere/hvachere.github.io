<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to transfer the heat to the rooms. Most modern-day hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ).

The radiators may be installed on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
