<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in location. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one reaction specified the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated use of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature wear and tear, causing holes and cracks.
