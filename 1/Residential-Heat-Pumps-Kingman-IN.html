<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
