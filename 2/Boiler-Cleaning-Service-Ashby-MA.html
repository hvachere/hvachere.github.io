Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
