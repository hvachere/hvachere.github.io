<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.
