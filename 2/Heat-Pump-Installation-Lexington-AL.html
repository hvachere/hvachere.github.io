<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Lexington AL</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home building is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in floorings, roofs, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
