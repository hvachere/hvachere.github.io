Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
