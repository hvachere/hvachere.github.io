<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
