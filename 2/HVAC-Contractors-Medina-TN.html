<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood items made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items made for indoor usage include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is generally recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
