<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
