<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.

<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may discover unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>

She didn't need a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
