<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Lewisville PA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
