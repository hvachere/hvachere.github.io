<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
