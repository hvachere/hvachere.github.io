<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they ought to be put.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside buildings are generally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
