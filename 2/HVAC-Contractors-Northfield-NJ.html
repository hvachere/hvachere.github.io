Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if required, update the structure envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation might be a more efficient option to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
