<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits utilize dose-response information which reveal the health effects of repeated exposure to one specific chemical. Comparable data is not offered for long-lasting, low-level direct exposures to a combination of pollutants as is the case for IAQ issues. Currently, there is not enough information readily available to anticipate the impacts of exposure to numerous possibly harmful agents at the exact same time.<p>
