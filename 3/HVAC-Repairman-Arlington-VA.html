<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
