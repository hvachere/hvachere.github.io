<h3>Water Boiler Repair in Yuma AZ</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
