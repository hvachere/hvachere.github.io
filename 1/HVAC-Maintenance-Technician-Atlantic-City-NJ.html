<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
