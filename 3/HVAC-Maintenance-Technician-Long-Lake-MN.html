Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling result.
