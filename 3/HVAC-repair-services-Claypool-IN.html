<p>Central air units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes dirty and old.

A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
