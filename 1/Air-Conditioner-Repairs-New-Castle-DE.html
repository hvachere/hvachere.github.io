<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>There are numerous things to take into account when trying to determine how typically I should change my cooling filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a special DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better ideal choice on how typically your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less typically you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one a/c filter need replacing more frequently.<p>
