<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
