"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
