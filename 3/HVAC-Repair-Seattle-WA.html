<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Many detach blocks contain 2 cartridge merges. Inspect them before you continue with repairs (Photo 3). A blown fuse is a sign of a stopping working part inside the condensing unit.
