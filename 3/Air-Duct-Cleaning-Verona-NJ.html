<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building and construction or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities.
