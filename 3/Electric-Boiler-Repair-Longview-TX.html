<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
