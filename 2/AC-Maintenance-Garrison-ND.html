<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
