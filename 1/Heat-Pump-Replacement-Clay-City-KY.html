<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Clay City KY</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very delighted that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system before you purchase.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
