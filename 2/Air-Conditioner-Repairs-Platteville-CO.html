<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
