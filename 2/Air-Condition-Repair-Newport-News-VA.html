He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.

<p>The most typical kind of house heating system in the U.S. burns gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive alternative, but newer systems can be extremely energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems usually accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely effective natural gas heaters can attain AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
