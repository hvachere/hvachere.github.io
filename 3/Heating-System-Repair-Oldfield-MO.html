<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
