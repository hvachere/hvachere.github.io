<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
