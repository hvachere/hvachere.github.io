<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
