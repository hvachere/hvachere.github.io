<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system.
