<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
