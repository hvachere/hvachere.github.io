<h3>Things Every Homeowner Truth About Hiring Mountainside NJ HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
