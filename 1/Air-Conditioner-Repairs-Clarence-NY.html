He dedicated to the task based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few sensible ones received. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post install examination outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
