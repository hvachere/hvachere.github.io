<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ may observe musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
