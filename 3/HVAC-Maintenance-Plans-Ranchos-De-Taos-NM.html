<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot beside the radiators.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
