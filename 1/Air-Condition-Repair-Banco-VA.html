<p>The rest of the HVAC system also requires to be in top condition for the a/c unit to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the house.

<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept clean.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.
