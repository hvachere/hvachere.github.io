<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it because it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow limitation will reduce the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The most typical type of house heating unit in the U.S. burns gas or lp to produce heat.
