<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
