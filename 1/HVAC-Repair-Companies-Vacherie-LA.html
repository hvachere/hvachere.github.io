<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, because it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
