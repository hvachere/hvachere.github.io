<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was kind of odd being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.

Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
