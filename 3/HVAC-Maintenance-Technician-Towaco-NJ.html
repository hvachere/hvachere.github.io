<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
