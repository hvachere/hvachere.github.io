<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<h3>Boiler Installation in Foley MN</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who live in the home. Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items. Infections and bacteria, family pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
