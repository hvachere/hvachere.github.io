<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time using Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is skilled with these gadgets). I have absolutely nothing however great things to say - he has actually taken great care of my heating and AC needs. Quick response - quick resolution.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
