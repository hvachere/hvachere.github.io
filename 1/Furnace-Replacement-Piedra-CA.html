<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Piedra CA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might invest more money on cooling expenses in the long run since of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
