Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
