<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
