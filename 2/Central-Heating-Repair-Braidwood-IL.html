<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Braidwood IL?</h3>
<p>Medical facility operating theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to minimize infection threat and the humidity controlled to limit patient dehydration. Although temperature levels are often in the comfort range, some professional procedures, such as open heart surgery, need low temperatures (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, reasonably high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both comfort and procedure applications, the objective may be to not just control temperature, however also humidity, air quality, and air movement from space to area.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
