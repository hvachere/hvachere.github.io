<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
