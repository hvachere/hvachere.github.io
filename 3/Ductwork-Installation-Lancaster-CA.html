It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
