<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
