<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
