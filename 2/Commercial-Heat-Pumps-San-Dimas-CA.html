<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
