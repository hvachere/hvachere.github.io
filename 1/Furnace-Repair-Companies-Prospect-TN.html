<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
