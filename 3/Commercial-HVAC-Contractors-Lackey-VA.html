<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to rise and flow out high building openings to the outside (stack result ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can utilize extremely little energy, but care should be taken to ensure convenience. In warm or damp climates, preserving thermal convenience solely by means of natural ventilation might not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>

The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
