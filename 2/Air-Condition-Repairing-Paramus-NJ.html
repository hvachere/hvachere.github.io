<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, many of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

Any disturbance or disturbance in the circulation of electrical power makes the system inoperable. This is one of the disadvantages to setting up an electric convected heat system. Nevertheless, presuming they are installed correctly and properly looked after, the probability of them having issues is small.<p>
