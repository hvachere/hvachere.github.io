<p>HVAC systems have moving pasts in compressor s, circulation units, and heating systems. These moving parts need to be oiled regularly to minimize friction and the resultant wear and tear.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside.

Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
