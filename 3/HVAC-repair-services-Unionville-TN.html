<h3>AC Replacement Service in Unionville TN</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
