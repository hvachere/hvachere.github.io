<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
