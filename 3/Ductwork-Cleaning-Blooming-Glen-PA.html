<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably lowers direct exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Incorrect change, often indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you purchase a new gas stove or range, consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly. Never ever use a gas range to heat your house. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
