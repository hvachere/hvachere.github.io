<p>There are 2 main types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating business. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are forced to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that best temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service strategy which normally consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
