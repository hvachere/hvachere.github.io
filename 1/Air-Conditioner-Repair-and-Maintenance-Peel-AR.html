<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them until they have actually been appropriately dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
