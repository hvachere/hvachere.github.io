<p>Indoor air quality problems are not limited to homes. In truth, many office buildings have considerable air pollution sources Some of these structures may be improperly ventilated. For example, mechanical ventilation systems may not be created or run to provide sufficient quantities of outside air.

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow limitation will lower the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
