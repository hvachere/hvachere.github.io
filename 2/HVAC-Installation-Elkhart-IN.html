<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step.
