<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
