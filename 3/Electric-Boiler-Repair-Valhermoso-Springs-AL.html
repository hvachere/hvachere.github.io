<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>The Way to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing in Valhermoso Springs AL</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
