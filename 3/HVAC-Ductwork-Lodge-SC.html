<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
