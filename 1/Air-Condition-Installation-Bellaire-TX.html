Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged.

Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
