<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>There are many sources of indoor air contamination in any house. These include combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, wood, tobacco, and coal items; building products and furnishings as diverse as shabby, asbestos-containing insulation, wet or damp carpet, and kitchen cabinetry or furnishings made of specific pushed wood items; products for household cleaning and maintenance, individual care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling systems and humidification gadgets; and outdoor sources such as radon, pesticides, and outside air contamination.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer must inspect measurements of air, temperature and humidity flow. In addition, assessment and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for developing usage and occupancy) must be carried out. A structure walk-through to check for smells and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings might be useful. Leakages require to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with fungi or bacteria and need to be eliminated, likewise. In some scenarios, particular screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of structure occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Risk Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>HVAC coils generally give you a good 15-20 years of life before they start developing refrigerant leakages. Refrigerant leaks aren't the only issue cooling coils have.

The overall operating refrigerant pressures will increase dramatically, causing your HVAC systems oil, compressor, & capacitor to breakdown quicker.<p>
