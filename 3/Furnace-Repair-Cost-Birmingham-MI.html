<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
