<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers warmth from the floor up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>

For instance, house owners may wish to try to find one that includes a built-in filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular feature to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to decrease energy costs even more. Naturally, more functions suggest higher central air conditioning expenses.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues.
