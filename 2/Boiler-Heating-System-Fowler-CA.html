The companies were not warned they became part of a study, and the scientists did not control for time spent or methods utilized. The EPA study prescribed and managed methods utilized on a smaller sized number of homes.

<p>Similar to most home improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can vary commonly based on the size of the house. The majority of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years.

<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
