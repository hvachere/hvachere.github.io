<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Denver NC</h3>

They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
