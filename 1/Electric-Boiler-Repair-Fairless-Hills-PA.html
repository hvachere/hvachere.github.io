<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%.
