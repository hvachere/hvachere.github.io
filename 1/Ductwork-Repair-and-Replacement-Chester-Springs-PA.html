<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
