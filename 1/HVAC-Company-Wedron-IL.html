<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally brought on by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the main problem in more than half the office indoor air investigations it has actually carried out. Investigations performed in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be true. These investigations exposed that proper ventilation is necessary in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are prone to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers heat from the floor up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>

This can result in the capacity for substantial illness.<p>
