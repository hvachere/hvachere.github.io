<h3>Steam Boiler Repair in Tortilla Flat Arizona</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Tortilla Flat AZ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
