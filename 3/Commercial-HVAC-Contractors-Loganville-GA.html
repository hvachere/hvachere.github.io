If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
