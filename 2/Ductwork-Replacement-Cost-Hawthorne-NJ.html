<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
