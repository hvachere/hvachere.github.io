In numerous split-system air conditioners, this indoor cabinet likewise contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump. The air conditioning system's evaporator coil is set up in the cabinet or main supply duct of this furnace or heatpump. If your house currently has a furnace but no air conditioner, a split-system is the most cost-effective central air conditioning conditioner to set up.<p>

While geothermal systems do utilize some electricity, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other toxins than heating unit that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn supplied terrific customer service at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may want to have actually performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
