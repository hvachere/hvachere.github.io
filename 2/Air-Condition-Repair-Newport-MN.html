<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, since the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
