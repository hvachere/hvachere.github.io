<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Employ professionals and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated professionals carry out far better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.
