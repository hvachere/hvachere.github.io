Many typical structure materials utilized before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimum due to the fact that the fibers can be spread into the air during the elimination process. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is frequently advised instead.<p>
