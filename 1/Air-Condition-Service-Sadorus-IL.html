Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure.
