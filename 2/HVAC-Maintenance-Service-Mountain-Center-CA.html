<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
