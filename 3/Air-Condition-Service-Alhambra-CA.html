<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any airflow limitation will lower the system's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
