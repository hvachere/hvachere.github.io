<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
