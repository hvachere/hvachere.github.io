The key portion of your air conditioning is the outside system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its positioning on your home and its upkeep, it might sustain some damage throughout the winter. Most of the time, this just includes some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is pretty simple to remove.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
