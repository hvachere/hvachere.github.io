(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
