<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality.
