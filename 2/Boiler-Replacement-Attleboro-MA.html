<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the conventional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available. It is likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Set up unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
