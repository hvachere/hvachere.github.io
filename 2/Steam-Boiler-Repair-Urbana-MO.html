<h3>What You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Urbana MO</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
