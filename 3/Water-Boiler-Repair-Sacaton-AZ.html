<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
