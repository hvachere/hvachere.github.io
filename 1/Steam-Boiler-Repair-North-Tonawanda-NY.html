<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
