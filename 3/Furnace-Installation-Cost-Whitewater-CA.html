<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be residing in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But a number of the things individuals do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne impurities in their houses and aggravate asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>A/c unit makers typically make rugged, high quality items. Begin by examining any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool down for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers.
