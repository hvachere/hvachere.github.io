<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxic substances. Signs of health problems triggered by biological toxins consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
