<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to install, especially in an older house. Depending upon the kind of unit installed, it can be loud and cause problems if you're extremely adverse dust. Furthermore, certain fuels and equipment may need special permits, and there is limited versatility in case of altered heating requirements. During usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>Many well and city water does not normally include lead. Water normally gets lead inside the home from household pipes that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked, the only way to know. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water evaluated. Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
