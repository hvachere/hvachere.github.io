<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However a number of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of airborne pollutants in their homes and aggravate asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>In the middle of the winter, when the air is bone-bitingly cold, the last thing you want is a heater that can't get the job done. That's why heating is among the most essential aspects of any Tacoma, WA area home comfort system. It doesn't just keep you comfy, it keeps you safe. At the exact same time, however, you desire your heater to be as effective and eco-friendly as possible to keep your expenses down and your home warm.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your car. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter as soon as every three months. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
