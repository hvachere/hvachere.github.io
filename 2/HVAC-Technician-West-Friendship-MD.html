<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening.

<p>Mobile houses are usually smaller than stick-built residential or commercial properties and utilize considerably less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
