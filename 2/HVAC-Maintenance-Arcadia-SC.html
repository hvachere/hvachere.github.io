<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>

<p>New heating systems are considerably more efficient than those of 10 or more years earlier, cutting costs by as much as 30%.
