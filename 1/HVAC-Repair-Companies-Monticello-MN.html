<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in Monticello</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electrical energy or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can attain as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
