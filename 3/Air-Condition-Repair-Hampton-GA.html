A lot of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate contaminants directly from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
