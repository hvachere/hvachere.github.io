This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
