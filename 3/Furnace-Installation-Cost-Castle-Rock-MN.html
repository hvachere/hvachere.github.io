You can save on your programmable thermostat while you are resting, & provide your air conditioning system breaks at least 2-3 hours every night while you are sleeping. Because your attic is cool & and the Midtown Montrose ambient temperature is hot. Most people set their programmable thermostats to switch off in between 3 am-5 am.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
