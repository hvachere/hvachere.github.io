<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure fact that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is just as important as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will frequently develop in ductwork, restricting air flow.

When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not have to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
