<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
