<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is extremely efficient and beneficial, particularly throughout the Summer while the system acts to cool one's house. This is because the excess heat absorbed from within the house is conducted into the hot water tank instead of being transferred back into the earth.

Moreover, throughout winter, the heat from underground can be absorbed to heat domestic water together with its main purpose of providing space heating. This means that cost savings are still realized throughout the colder duration. In fact, a desuperheater lowers winter season water heating costs by around 50 percent.<p>
