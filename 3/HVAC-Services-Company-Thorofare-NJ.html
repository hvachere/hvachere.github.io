<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements too. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous spaces at the same time, but are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house.
