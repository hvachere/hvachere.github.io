Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays.

<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems.
