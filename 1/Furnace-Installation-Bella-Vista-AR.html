Their techs are expert and extremely educated. Costs are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser today.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.
