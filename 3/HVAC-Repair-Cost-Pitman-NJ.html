<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
