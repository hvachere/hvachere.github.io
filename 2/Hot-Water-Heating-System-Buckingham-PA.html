<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable natural compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances.

Secondly, there ought to not be any challenges en route of the air flow that might prevent it from covering the space of the properties as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from your home will not be efficiently discharged outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop greatly.
