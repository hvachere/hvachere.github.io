<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They include delays in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, kids, and babies are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
