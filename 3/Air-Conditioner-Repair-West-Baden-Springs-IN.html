<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
