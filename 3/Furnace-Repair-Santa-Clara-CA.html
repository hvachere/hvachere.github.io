<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace at Santa Clara CA</h3>
<p>I was very happy in the beginning since things ran efficiently with no noise. Moreover, I saw obvious modifications in my electrical power expenses. After two years, things started to change. There have been uncomfortable noises. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is completion of the issue. In general, it has actually been a great experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the beginning. But then recognized Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
