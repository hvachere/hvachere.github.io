<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse.
