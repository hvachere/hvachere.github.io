<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part.

<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was type of odd being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we fixed issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time.
