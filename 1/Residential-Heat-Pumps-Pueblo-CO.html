<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors eliminate pollutants directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

You may likewise call an HVAC contractor to perform routine maintenance on your system, or to repair damaged or malfunctioning heating or cooling systems.<p>
