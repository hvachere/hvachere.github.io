However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
