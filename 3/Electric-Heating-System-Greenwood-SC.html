<p>Examine these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed.

Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
