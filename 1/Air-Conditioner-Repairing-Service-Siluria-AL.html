<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Siluria AL</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
