<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.
