<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work.

He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
