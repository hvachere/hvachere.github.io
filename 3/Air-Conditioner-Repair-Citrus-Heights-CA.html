<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
