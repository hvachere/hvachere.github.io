<p>I have been using them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is sincere, reliable, and sensible on price. It's tough to discover a sincere AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ¬∞ F and an indoor temp of 80 ¬∞ F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Many AC systems feature a number of special features that can even more improve performance and performance. For instance, house owners might wish to search for one that includes an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular feature to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on during the night to decrease energy expenses even more. Naturally, more functions mean higher central air expenses.<p>
<p>By piping coolant directly into the smaller sized wall-mounted units, ductless divides permit you to avoid the requirement for a complete duct system like a lot of other cooling systems require. You will likewise take pleasure in a far more versatile system in regards to installation and cost. And because each indoor system has its own thermostat, you can bid farewell to thermostat warfare when someone would choose it a little warmer in a different space.<p>
