<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.

No additional charge.<p>

<p>You need to constantly work with an expert to conduct AC repair, for the very same factor that you rely on an expert plumbing professional or electrician. You don't perform repairs on your own plumbing system, or change your own electrical grid. The reasons that you don't do those things are apparent. You don't have the tools, or the expertise, to be sure that you perform those treatments safely and properly. Professionals, nevertheless, do have the tools and knowledge to do the task correctly.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
