<h3>Ways to Get the Most From Your HVAC System in Orangeburg NY</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in top condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the house.

Sealing leaks in ductwork can enhance HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler home in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
