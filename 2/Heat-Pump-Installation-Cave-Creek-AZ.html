A lot of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

A service plan for an HVAC company that means to pursue this avenue needs to reveal a high level of understanding about smart home HVAC products and consumer adoption.<p>
