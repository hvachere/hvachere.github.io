These convection heating units are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your house, supplying a comfy environment in every space. However ducts that are not set up appropriately or kept can distribute impurities from one space to another.
