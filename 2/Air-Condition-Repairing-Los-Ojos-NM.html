EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
