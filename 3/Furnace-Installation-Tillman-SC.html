<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a reference later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
