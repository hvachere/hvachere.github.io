<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the United States your home is located, the local region's environment can change significantly. A house situated in the South would need an AC unit with a size efficient in cooling your house due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would need a much larger heating capability too which will impact costs. See the chart below for the typical central air conditioning conditioner replacement costs by LOADS.<p>
