Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

In a situation where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality might have been jeopardized, mold removal may be required. Mold testing and evaluations must be performed by an independent detective to prevent any dispute of interest and to insure accurate results; totally free mold screening provided by removal companies is not recommended.<p>
