<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit.

The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
