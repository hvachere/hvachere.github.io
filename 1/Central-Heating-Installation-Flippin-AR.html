<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they ought to be placed. Most commonly they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people mostly stay seated in that particular location.

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside buildings are generally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
