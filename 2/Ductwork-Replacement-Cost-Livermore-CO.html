<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects.
