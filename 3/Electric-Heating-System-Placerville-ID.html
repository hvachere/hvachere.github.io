Used along with other forms of heating or cooling, such as portable or window air conditioning unit, area heating units, or oil heating units, it can boost the comfort of your house while keeping your month-to-month energy costs affordable.<p>
<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
