<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
