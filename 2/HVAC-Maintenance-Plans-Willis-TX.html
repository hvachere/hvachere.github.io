Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>

Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
