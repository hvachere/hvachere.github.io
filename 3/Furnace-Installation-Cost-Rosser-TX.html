Many times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally just available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
