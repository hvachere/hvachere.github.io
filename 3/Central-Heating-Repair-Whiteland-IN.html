<p>My eldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
