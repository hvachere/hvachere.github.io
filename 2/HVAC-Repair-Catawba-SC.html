<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Catawba SC</h3>
<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological contaminants are wet or wet building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem triggered by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Various fungi and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are pets and home plants.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
