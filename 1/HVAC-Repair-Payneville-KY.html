The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%.

Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not basic, given that it takes into consideration not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
