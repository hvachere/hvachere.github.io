The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most economical if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
