<h3>Ductwork Replacement Cost in Doniphan Nebraska</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect.
