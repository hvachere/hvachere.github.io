<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space a/c offers optimum versatility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
