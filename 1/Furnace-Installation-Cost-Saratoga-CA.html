<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
