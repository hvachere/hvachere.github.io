<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, as well as all other kinds of heatpump, have actually performances ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a scientific method of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. The majority of geothermal heat pump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for every unit of energy utilized to power the system, three to five systems are supplied as heat.<p>
