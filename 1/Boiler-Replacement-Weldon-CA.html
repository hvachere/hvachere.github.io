<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>It might just require to be cleaned if your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running. Whether this is the cause of the issue, it's a good early treatment to attempt.
