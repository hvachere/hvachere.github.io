<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S).

Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.)
