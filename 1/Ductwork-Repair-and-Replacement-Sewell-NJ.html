The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
