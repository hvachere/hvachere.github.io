<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
