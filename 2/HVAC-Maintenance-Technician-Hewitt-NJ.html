<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
