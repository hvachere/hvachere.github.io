<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
