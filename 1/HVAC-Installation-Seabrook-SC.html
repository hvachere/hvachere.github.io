The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
