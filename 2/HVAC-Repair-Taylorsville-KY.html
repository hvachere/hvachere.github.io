<h3>How to Choose An Expert HVAC Tech in Taylorsville KY</h3>
<p>For whole house installations, it's tough, if almost impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, especially a hydronic system. Localized radiant flooring heat systems to be used in one or several spaces like bathrooms, kitchens or utility room are easily renovated with electric glowing floor heat. This is much more cost-efficient on a smaller sized scale. Bigger renovations like additions to a house may be suitable for a bigger scale and more costly hydronic system.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
