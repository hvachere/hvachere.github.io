Their techs are really knowledgeable and professional. Costs are sensible. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get rival's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff due to the fact that the cost was certainly reasonable.<p>

For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>
