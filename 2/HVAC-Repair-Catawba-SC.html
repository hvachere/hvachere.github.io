He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
