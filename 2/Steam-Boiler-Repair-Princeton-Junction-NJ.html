<p>For whole home installations, it's hard, if almost difficult, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, specifically a hydronic system. Localized glowing flooring heat systems to be utilized in one or a number of rooms like bathrooms, kitchens or laundry rooms are quickly renovated with electric radiant floor heat. This is much more cost-efficient on a smaller sized scale. Bigger remodellings like additions to a house might be suitable for a bigger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>

The parts we utilize are backed up with a two-year parts guarantee when we do any repair.
