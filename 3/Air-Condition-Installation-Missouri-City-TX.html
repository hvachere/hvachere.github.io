<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In a lot of cases, if materials have stopped working to dry out several days after the suspected water event, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not instantly noticeable. Through a mold examination, which might include destructive inspection, one must have the ability to determine the presence or absence of mold. In a situation where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold removal might be needed. Mold screening and inspections should be performed by an independent detective to avoid any dispute of interest and to guarantee precise results; free mold screening provided by removal companies is not advised.<p>
