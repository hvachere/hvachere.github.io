<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies.

<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Olmsted Falls Ohio</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a cars and truck radiator or typical household air conditioning system does.
