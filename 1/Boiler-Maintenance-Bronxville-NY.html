<p>The function of most building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at reasonable energy costs. Load calculating is referred to as the Manual J computation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone. Similar to determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, determining the correct size of system for your house likewise depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
