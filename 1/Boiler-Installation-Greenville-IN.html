<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad.

A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
