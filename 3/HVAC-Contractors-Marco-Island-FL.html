<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
