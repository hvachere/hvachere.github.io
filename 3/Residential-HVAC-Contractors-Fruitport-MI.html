<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can mean substantial cost savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limitations use dose-response information which show the health results of repetitive exposure to one particular chemical. Comparable information is not available for long-lasting, low-level direct exposures to a combination of impurities as is the case for IAQ problems. Presently, there is insufficient details offered to predict the results of exposure to numerous possibly harmful agents at the exact same time.<p>
