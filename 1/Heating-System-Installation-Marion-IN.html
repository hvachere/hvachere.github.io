<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
