<h3>How to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Santa Monica CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater.
