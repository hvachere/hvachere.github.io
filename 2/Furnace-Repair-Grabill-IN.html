<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
