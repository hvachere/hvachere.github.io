<h3>Commercial HVAC in Shelton WA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
