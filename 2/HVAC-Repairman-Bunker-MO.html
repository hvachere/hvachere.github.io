<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a moderate climate, where the temperature does not get expensive or too low. To put it simply, they are perfect for our Seattle climate! They are extremely efficient, beating out most other kinds of heating unit in performance. The only genuine exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation generally costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which normally implies it fails in terms of return on investment.<p>
