<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Mountain Home NC Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
