<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
