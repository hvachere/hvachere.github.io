They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to order it. My partner stated that she had actually seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good individuals I have satisfied in a very long time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
