<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
