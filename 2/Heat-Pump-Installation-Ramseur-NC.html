According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.
