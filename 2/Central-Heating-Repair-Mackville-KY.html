<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner".

The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
