<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it requires from the capacitor.

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
