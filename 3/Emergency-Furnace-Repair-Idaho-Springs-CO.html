<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
