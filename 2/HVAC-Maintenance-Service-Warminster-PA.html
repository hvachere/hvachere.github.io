These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation.
