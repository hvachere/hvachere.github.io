In some cases it's not a significant problem, and your system may just need some maintenance work.

Do not hesitate to inquire about our service plans that consist of preventive maintenance if you want to stay ahead of any issues with your house or service HVAC system, so you can avoid pricey repairs or replacements.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with particles that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

By comparison, examining and replacing a furnace filter can typically be done in simply a couple of minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by the majority of public water supplies, it has been discovered in well water. If you've evaluated the air in your home and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory certified to measure radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon problems in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one aspect (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that perfect temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which normally consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, ceiling, and flooring coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours might become a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. In some cases there is a musty smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in surprise or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
