<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Lees Summit Missouri</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>

<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too little to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can stay and build up in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be deadly). Signs of these diseases do not show up till several years after exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothes and devices brought home from job websites.<p>
