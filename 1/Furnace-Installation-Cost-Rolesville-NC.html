<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues in houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electricity, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private spaces. All-electric boilers can achieve up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a large merchant who asked not to be called since he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that routinely monitors energy consumption and temperatures in stores to minimize costs (especially during the night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the shops fluctuate beyond an acceptable range that might avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
