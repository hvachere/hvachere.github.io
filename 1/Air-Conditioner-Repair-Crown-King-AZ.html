<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's probably your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to defrost your air conditioning devices. The simplest way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
