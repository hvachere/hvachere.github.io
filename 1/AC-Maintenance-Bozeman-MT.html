<h3>AC Duct Repair in Bozeman Montana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the visit. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Taylor took adequate time to help us debate which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's items and services was outstanding. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the required electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
