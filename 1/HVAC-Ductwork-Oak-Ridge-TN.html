<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Because they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
