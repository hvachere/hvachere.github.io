<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Kids may have greater direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Using air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource area recommends that "Air Filtration should have a Minimum Performance Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can function as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can minimize the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>Speaking of air, radiant heat systems tend to enhance indoor air quality.
