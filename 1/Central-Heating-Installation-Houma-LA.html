<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video footage. They utilize a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs needed to heat the area. The larger the area, the more powerful the home heating system needs to be. For already constructed house heating systems, the contractor will need to get rid of the old furnace to include the brand-new one. These charges will be included in the installation costs.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger.

Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
