<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold development and moisture inside your home is connected with a higher frequency of resident respiratory problems.<p>
