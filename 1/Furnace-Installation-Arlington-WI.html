While you can certainly buy your furnace yourself, many contractors won't guarantee the furnace or might not install it if you don't purchase it from them. Installation charges vary throughout the county, however begin at roughly $50 per hour up to $150 or more. It takes roughly 5 hours to set up a little furnace and more to install a large one.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we offer guidance to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older system.<p>

<p>The primary health effect related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
