<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>

Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
