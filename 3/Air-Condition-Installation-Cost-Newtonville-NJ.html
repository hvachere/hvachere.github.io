<h3>Air Condition Repairing in Newtonville New Jersey</h3>

Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
