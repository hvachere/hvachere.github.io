<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
