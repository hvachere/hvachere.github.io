<p>The company's head workplace is based in Cosmo City, Gauteng, and where they distribute their item in all locations in South Africa and nearby countries, such as Mozambique, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. There are Jet-Air branches in the Western Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, Free State and North West, to supply better consumer experiences and ease of access of the products in every area.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
