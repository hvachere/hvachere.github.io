Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and viruses, pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
