<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other types of a/c unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.<p>
