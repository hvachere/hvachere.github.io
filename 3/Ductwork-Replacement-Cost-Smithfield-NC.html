<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
