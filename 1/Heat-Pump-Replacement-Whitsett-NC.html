<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Important Service in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year back and they've been to your home for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have actually managed the one repair I required well, and are always on-time and expert. Have actually been through a few companies for many years and Wachoff's is definitely the best I've had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been great.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
