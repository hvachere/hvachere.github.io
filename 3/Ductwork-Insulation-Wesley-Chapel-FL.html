<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing product acquired with your home. This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the evaluation on a really cold day they killed the furnace claiming health danger reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new homeowner I have found out how to determine the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
