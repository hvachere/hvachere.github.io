<p>My oldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
