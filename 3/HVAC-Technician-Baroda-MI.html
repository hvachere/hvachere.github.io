<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the exact same).

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
