Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
