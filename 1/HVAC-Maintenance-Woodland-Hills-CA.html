<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Woodland Hills CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
