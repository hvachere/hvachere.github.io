<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.
