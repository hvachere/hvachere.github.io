<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
