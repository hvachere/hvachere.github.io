That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Star NC</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally caused by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the workplace indoor air investigations it has actually performed. Examinations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the same to be real. These investigations exposed that appropriate ventilation is important in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen could induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might select to change the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit if you do so. Nevertheless, considering current changes in refrigerants and cooling styles, it may be wiser to change the whole system.<p>
