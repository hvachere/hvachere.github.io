<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body.

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months prior to the present one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
