<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Heat Ventilation in Wyocena WI</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
