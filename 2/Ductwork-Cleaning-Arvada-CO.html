<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and efficiency if you currently have a home heating system.

The bright side is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
