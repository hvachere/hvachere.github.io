<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Kings Mountain NC</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
