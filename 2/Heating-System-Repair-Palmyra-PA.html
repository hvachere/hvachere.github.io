<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
