My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly treat and solidify-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
