<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, given that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
