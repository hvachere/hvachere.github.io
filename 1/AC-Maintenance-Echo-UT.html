<p>The primary health result related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
