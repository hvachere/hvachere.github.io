<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
