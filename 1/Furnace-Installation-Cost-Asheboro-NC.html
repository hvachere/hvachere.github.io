<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>The most typical type of home heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat. With a typical cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly alternative, however newer systems can be really energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems normally achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly effective gas heaters can attain AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
