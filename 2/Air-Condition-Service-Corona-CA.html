<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
