<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was kind of strange being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
