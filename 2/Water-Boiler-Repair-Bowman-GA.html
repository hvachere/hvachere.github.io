<h3>HVAC Technician in Bowman GA</h3>
<p>Remember that the SEER ranking is computed using the same set of temperatures throughout the board. The average summer temperature to get to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to get to the proper SEER ranking for your location, deduct 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning units manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we advise using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
