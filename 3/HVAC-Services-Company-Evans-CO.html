The air was cooled, and thereby the quantity of wetness in the air might be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The regulated temperature level and humidity helped maintain consistent paper measurements and ink positioning. Later on, Carrier's technology was used to increase productivity in the office, and The Provider A/c Company of America was formed to fulfill increasing demand.

So, make certain to change your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which usually includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
