<h3>AC And Heating Repair in Lyons IL</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on uncommon occasions.<p>
