<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and problem in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might activate attacks in people with asthma. There is evidence that some individuals can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has actually also been shown to trigger cancer in animals and may trigger cancer in people.<p>
<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
