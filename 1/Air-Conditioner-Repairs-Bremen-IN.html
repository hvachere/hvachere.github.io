<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a variety of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized building materials, home furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, but much of the threat also comes from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service strategy which usually consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those looking to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
