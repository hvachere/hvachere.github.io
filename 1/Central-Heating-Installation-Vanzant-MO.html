However, pick your contractor carefully, many of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floorings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
