<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
