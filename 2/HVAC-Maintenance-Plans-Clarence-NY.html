Manufacturers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is committed to providing a work environment that is free of recognized hazards and to investigation problems that may be related to poor indoor air quality (IAQ).
