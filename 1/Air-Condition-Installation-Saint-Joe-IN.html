Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
