<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one reaction stated the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided.

If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
