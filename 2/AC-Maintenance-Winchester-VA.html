Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
