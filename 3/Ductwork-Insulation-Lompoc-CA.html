<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location.

<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with two local companies for quotes. While both were informative and practical, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a better deal, for remarkable service. Rather than a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and situated methods we might have more even heat. He included these small but considerable adjustments in his quote. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump due to the fact that of recent warmer summer seasons and for ecological reasons.<p>
