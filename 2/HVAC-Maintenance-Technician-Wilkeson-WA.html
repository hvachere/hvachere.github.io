<p>Make sure there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not only will obstructed vents and signs up impact your convenience, they can also result in duct leakages due to extreme atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused rooms is NOT an excellent concept. You won't conserve any money and will end up triggering more problems for your heating unit.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
