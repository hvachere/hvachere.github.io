All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense.

For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a very beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
