They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed frequently, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to. The heating and cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will worsen. Inspecting and changing the air filters is one of the most crucial elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
