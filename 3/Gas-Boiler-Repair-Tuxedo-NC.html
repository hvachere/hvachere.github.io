<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Furnace in Tuxedo NC</h3>
<p>Sean was very useful. He is a really pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
