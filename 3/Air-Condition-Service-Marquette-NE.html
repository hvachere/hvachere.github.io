When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater.
