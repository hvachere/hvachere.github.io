Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
