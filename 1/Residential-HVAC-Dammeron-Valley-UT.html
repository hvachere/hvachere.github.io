<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
