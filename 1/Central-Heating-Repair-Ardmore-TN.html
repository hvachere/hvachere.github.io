<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, stated Pueblo tries to find more than simply additional income or scale when it makes acquisitions - it searches for companies that can broaden Pueblo's client base or offer a new line of services. For instance, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo carried out restricted plumbing work for select customers. With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its capabilities, making it possible for a boosted value proposal for a wider set of clients.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.
