The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power needs to not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by at least 20%.

<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
