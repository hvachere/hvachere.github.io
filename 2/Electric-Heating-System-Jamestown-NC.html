<h3>Ventilation Systems in Jamestown NC</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions ought to also be taken to reduce contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, residents ought to be alert to the development of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization steps need to not be undertaken up until these issues have been fixed.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the tools or skills required to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician examine the system regularly.<p>

<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically important to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can often be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
