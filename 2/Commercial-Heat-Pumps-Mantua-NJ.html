<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, given that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
