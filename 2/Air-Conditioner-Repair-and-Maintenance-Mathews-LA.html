<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractor in Mathews</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes require effective ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other workplaces is essential not just for workers' convenience but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been tied to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, problem focusing, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some particular illness have been linked to specific air pollutants or indoor environments, like asthma with damp indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause instant symptoms however can lead to cancer after several years.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators employed hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
