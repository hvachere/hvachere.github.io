<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Mount Vernon MO Home</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by just using the services of a certified contractor or a licensed representative from a company or retailer to do the installation. If you choose to attempt to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed individual to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the cooling system. A voided service warranty won't do you any great should the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the get-go and work with a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
