<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around given that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping device to distribute hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the flooring heat moved heat to other posts in the rooms, consisting of the human occupants.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit makers normally make rugged, high quality products. Start by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil change in your car. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
