<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
