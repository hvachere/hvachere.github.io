<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Vaughn WA</h3>
<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually enjoyed the single-family home installation business completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
