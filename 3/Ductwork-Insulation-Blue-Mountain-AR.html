Pushed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is usually acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
