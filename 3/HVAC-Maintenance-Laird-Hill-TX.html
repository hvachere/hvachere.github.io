<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Old furnaces often do not have the ability to hydrate and clean the air in your house. Your house air might feel stuffy or stagnant.
