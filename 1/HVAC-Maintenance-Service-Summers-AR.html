<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, because the unit is combined.
