<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
