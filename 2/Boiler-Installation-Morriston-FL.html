In a situation where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold removal might be needed. Mold testing and examinations need to be performed by an independent investigator to prevent any conflict of interest and to insure accurate outcomes; totally free mold screening used by removal companies is not suggested.<p>
