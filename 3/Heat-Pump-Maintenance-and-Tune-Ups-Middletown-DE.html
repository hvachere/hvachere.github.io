<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
