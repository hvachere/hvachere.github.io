<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils.

It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
