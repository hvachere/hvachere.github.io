<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
