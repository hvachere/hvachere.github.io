Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
