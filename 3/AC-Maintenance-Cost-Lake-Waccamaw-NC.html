<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stale air might likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold enjoy moisture. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other allergens under control. A dehumidifier (and a/c during summertime) helps reduce wetness in indoor air and successfully controls irritants, Lang says. An air conditioner also minimizes indoor pollen count - another plus for allergic reaction -patients.<p>
