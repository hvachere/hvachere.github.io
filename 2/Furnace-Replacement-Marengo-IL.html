<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
