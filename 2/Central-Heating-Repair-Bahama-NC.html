<h3>Gas Heating in Bahama NC</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
