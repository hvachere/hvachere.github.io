Heaters that kick on regularly might be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly.

While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
