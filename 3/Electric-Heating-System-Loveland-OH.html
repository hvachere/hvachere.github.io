<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
