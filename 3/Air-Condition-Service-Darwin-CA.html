Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's probably your problem.
