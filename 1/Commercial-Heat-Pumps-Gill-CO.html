<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance.
