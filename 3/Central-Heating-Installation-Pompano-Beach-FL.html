<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a straightforward and effective  technique to decrease ambient air contamination and possible health threats, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
