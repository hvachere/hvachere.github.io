<h3>Residential HVAC Contractors in Dayton VA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke.
