<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Germantown TN</h3>
<p>Sean was really practical. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Germantown TN</h3>
<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products.

EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a dependable methods of decreasing the health threat from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides further information on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A good place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation.
