<h3>AC And Heating Repair in Templeton California</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
