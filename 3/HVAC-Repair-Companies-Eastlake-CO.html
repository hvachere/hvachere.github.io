<p>Customer products which contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to cause cancer in animals.

<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>

However, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

However, presuming they are installed properly and appropriately looked after, the likelihood of them having issues is small.<p>
