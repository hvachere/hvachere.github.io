<p>Inspect these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
