<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is designed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure products, cigarette smoking, home products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in manufactured products. For instance, it is utilized to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a part of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing products.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

Gas heating systems cost about the exact same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home.
