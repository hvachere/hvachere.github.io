<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known reality that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is simply as important as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will frequently develop in ductwork, restricting airflow.

<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as simply glowing systems.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
