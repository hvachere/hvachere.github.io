We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- usually two to 4 weeks.
