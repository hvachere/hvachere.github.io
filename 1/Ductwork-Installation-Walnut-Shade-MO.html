<p>UW visitors, students and workers must have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and carry out various activities. , if the air quality is poor it can impact a person's comfortConvenience productivity, and healthEfficiencyEfficiency The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to supply and preserve healthy and comfy environments free of pollutants. A key part of the program is responding to and fixing concerns of building residents about problems in their work environment.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
