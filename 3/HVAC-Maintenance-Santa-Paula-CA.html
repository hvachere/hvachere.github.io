<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur in time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
