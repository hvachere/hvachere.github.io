<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness inside is associated with a greater occurrence of resident breathing problems.<p>
<p>A geothermal desuperheater is helpful and very effective, especially throughout the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's home. This is since the excess heat absorbed from within the house is conducted into the hot water tank instead of being sent back into the earth. The result, therefore, is totally free warm water! Additionally, throughout winter, the heat from underground can be soaked up to heat domestic water together with its primary function of offering space heating. This suggests that cost savings are still recognized during the cooler duration. In fact, a desuperheater lowers winter season water heating costs by around half.<p>
