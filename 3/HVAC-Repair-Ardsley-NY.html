<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, do not position the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow constraint will lower the unit's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>These people have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I in some cases need contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a house may cost.

Even when it was news my customer probably would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>
