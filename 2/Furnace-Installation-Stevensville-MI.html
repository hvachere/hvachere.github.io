<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
