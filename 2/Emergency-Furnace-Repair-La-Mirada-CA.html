Nevertheless, considering that all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
