<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
