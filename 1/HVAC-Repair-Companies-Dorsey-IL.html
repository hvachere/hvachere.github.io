<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
