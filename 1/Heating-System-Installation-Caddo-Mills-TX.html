<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to replace 2 furnaces in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as developing products, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release contaminants more or less constantly. Other sources, related to activities like smoking cigarettes, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies release pollutants intermittently. Unvented or malfunctioning home appliances or improperly used items can release greater and in some cases unsafe levels of contaminants indoors.<p>
<p>There are a great deal of benefits to using a radiant heating system over a traditional forced air heater. Radiant heating systems tend to be far more energy efficient than other heating units, for one thing. Forced air heating systems tend to experience things like duct leaks, which rob them of approximately 30% of their output. Forced air heating unit also tend to generate cold and hot areas throughout your home, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a room and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>Outdoor impurities. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Professionals advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are better suited for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<p>Even newer heating systems less than five years of ages have actually been found as bad. A lot of property owners are surprised to find out that their 'new' furnace  heat exchanger. In many cases it is because of bad furnace design, however in most cases, it's from neglect.
