<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
