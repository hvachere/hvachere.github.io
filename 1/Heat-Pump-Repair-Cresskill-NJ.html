<p>Furthermore, property owners have a variety of options to select from in powering a floor heater. Glowing systems are compatible with electrical, gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.

The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
