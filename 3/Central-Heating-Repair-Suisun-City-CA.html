<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit.

But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
