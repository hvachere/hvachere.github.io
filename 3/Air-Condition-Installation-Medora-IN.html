<p>My oldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
