<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>

<p>. Before picking the installation place of air conditioning system, a number of main elements require to be thought about. First off, the direction of air circulation from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there must not be any obstacles on the way of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor unit must likewise be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully discharged outside and the performance of the whole system will drop dramatically. It is highly a good idea to set up the ac system units in easily available locations, for additional maintenance during operation.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
