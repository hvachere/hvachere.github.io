<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
