<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
