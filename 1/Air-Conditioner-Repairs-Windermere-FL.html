<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, consider potential results of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heater is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
