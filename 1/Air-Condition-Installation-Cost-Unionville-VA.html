<h3>Blocked Vents Repair in Unionville VA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
