<h3>AC Maintenance in Macks Creek MO</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
