<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to supply enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
