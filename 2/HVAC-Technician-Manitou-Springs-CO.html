Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home.
