<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy.
