<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems.

However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
