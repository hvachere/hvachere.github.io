<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to evaluate circumstance & chose to choose them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air going however also changed the heating system which was old.
