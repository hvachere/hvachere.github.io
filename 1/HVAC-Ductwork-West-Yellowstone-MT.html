<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually.
