<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, people exhale carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not hazardous, however might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to build up. Micro-organisms or bacteria may also exist within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the whole office or structure by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
