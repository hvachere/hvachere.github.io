When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
