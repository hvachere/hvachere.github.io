For this factor, it is necessary to focus on the time and location the symptoms take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is away from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
