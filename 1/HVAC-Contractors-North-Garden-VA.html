<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Because an a/c unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your house that perfect temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which normally includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
