<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
