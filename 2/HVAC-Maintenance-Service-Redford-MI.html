But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
