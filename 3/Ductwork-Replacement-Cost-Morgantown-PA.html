<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
