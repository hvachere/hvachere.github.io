<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.
