<p>I'll start with a gas furnace since it's the most typical heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process.

<p>Just like many house enhancement tasks, the cost of a full central heater can differ extensively based upon the size of the home. Most heaters will last in between 15 and twenty years.

Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the house.

<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
