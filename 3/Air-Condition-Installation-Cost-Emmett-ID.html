The outcomes can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
