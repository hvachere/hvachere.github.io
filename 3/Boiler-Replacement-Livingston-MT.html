Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure materials, smoking, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in manufactured products. For instance, it is utilized to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as an element of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and covering products.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the very same indoor air issues as single-family houses because much of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials, furnishings, and household items, are similar.
