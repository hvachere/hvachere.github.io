<h2>How To Hire HVAC Service in Chapel Hill</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
