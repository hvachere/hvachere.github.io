<p>Since the 1980s, makers of HVAC devices have been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more effective. This was originally driven by increasing energy expenses, and has more just recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental concerns.

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

The two operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
