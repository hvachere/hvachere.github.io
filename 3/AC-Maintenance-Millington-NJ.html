<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
