<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly seem higher than normal, it is most likely time to consider a brand-new system. New heating equipment is far more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills right now, not to mention the cash you'll save money on repair costs. If your heater is 25 years old or more, you can probably anticipate to cut your fuel expenses in half.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in effectiveness benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions because they don't require any new ductwork to be installed. Because an unit is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
