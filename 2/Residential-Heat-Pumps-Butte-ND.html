<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

In turn, the items in the space, like furniture and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
