<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a properly sized system.

That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
