<p>When installing radiant heat, you should give major idea to the type of floor covering in the house. Since it performs and stores heat, ceramic tile works well.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Goodspring TN</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections.

I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
