<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
