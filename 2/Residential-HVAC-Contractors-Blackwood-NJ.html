<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
