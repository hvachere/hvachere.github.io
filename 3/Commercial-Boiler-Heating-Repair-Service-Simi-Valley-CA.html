<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
