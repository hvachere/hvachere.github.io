<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Most trusted HVAC professionals will provide free estimates with an in-person service call. Beware of HVAC contractors who try to provide you a complimentary quote over the phone, as it may not accurately reflect what they will discover once they check out the system. Even if there is a charge for the cost price quote, that amount will typically be used towards your balance due, need to you decide to employ that contractor.<p>
<p>The main factor house owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services used.

<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items present a danger just when they are managed in a way that creates dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in.
