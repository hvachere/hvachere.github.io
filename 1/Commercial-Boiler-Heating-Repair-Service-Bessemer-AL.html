<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
