<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you hire to install your central air conditioning system. In fact, you can even DIY, regardless of our strong recommendation not to do so.

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
