Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
