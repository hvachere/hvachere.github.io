Their techs are really knowledgeable and expert. Expenses are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Because the cost was undoubtedly sensible, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly.

Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
