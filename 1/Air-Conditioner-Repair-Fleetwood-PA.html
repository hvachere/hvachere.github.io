<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on.

Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial price of a system competitive with traditional devices.
