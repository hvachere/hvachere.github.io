<p>Specific immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically difficult to determine if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is important to pay attention to the time and place the signs occur.

Some effects may be made worse by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions prevalent in the house.<p>
<p>Many people do not recognize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break with time.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
