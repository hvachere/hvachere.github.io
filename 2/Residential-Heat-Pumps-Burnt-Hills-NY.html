Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal.
