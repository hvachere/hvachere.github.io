<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
