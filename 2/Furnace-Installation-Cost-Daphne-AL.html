There are lots of ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, weakening paint, and dust.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.

Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
