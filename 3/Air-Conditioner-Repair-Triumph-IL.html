<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heating systems have multiple control panel. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard.

DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
