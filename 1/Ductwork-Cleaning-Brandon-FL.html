<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate because it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
