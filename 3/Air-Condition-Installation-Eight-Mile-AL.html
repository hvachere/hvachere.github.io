<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we resolved issues. I would suggest this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
