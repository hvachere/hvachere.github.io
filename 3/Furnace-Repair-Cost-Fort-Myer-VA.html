<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
