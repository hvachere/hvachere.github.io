<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other contaminants that can not just filthy up the air, but result in other health issues.

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t correctly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
