A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
