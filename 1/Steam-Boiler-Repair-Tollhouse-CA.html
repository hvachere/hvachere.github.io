<h3>The Way to Maintain Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Tollhouse CA</h3>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
