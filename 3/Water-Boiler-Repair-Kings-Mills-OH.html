Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
