<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
