<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
