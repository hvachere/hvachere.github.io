<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment in Wyandotte MI</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
