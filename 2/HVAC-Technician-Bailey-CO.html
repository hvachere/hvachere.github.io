<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they need to be put. Most frequently they are mounted at height-level or somewhat lower, if people mostly stay seated in that specific area. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending on what pollutant you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensor accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are typically near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
