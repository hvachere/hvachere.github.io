<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance.
