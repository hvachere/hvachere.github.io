<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
