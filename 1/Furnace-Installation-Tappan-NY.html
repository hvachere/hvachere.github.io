<p>A customized air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air path. A basic ac system transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
