Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler house in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a reference later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
