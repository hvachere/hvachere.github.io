<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
