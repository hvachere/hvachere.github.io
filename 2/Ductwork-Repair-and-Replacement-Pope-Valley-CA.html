<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
