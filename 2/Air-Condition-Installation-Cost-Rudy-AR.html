<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
