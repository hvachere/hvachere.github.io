<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Duct are accountable for distributing hot and cold air throughout your house, offering a comfy environment in every room. But ducts that are not installed appropriately or kept can disperse pollutants from one room to another. With time, dust, dander and even mold can collect in your ducts, lowering the general air quality. Hire a professional to make certain your ducts are distributing fresh, clean air.<p>
