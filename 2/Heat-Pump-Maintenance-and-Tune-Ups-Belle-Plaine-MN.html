<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit".

If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
