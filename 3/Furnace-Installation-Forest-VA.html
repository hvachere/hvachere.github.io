Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can become blocked with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's performance.
