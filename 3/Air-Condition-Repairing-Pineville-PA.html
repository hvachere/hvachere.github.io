<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
