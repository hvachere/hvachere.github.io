<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
