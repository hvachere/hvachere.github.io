<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
