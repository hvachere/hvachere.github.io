<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items provide a risk just when they are managed in a manner that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disturbed by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being air-borne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for significant health problems.<p>
