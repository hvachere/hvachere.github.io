<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
