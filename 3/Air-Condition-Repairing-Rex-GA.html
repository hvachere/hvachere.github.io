<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might observe musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk to your physician about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>

Such info can often be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent need to ask for that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this information may identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, monitoring data may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
