<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is created for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure products, smoking, family products, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in made items. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as an element of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing items.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the exact same indoor air problems as single-family homes since much of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure materials, home furnishings, and household products, are comparable. Indoor air problems comparable to those in workplaces are brought on by such sources as contaminated ventilation systems, incorrectly positioned outside air consumptions, or maintenance activities.<p>
