<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, industrial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning company. The essential portion of your cooling is the outside unit. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its placement on your home and its maintenance, it might sustain some damage throughout the winter season. The majority of the time, this simply consists of some buildup of dirt and particles, which is quite basic to eliminate. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the exterior of the unit and guarantee that there is no rust, damage from collected wetness, or excessive wear to the outside. They might advise that you trim overgrown trees or bushes to make sure adequate airflow around the unit.<p>

As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
