This stipulation, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that a company should provide a healthy and safe work environment. Therefore, making certain the air is of excellent quality is the employer's duty.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
