<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family home installation business entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
