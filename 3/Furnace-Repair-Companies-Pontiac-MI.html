<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many people.<p>

<p>Oil heaters are typically not very effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however a lot of do not attain an efficiency greater than 90%. A few high-end brand names have an efficiency of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000.
