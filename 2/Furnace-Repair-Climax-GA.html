<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a straightforward and efficient  method to minimize ambient air contamination and prospective health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants trigger allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Contagious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxic substances. Signs of health issue triggered by biological toxins consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive issues.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
