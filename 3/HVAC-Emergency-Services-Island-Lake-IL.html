<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils.

It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
