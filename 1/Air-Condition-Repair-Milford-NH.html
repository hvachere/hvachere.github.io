<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
