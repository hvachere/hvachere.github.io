If you are simply moving into your home or just beginning a restoration, you may want to set up a brand-new gas central heating system Installing a gas central heating system can be made complex, but it is absolutely a task that you can do yourself if you make the effort to determine what you are doing. Below are the actions you will need to require to complete this task.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
