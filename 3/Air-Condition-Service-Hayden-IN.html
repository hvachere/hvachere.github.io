<h3>Heating And Cooling Contractors in Hayden Indiana</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
