<p>Safe and secure individual eliminated cable televisions to the flooring using small blobs of hot-melt glue. Thoroughly cut and get rid of the orange mesh to release the cable television. Do this to work around sections, angles and barriers where full-width mats won't fit. Do not overlap the cable. When the whole mat is fitted and installed, press it firmly into the tape and hot-melt glue any loose ends or bulges in the mat. Carry out a resistance test to look for damage.<p>
