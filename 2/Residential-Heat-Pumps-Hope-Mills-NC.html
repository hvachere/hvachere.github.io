<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
