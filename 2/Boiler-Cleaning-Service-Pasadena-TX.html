<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
