<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Only a specialist can precisely detect why your furnace isn't beginning. If at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something seems odd or you lose confidence, it's time to call a professional. Likewise, if the process doesn't work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you need to do it often, it's probably time for an expert opinion.<p>
