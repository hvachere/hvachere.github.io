<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Richland Texas</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
